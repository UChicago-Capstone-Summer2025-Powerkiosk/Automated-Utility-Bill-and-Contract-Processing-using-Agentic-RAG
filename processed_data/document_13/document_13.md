2. Renewal: Prior to the end of the Current Term ("Current Term" means the Initial Term or a subsequent renewal Term, whichever is in effect), Seller may send Buyer a new offer ("Pricing Notice"), including a revised Rate and Term.

Without your written objection to that offer within 10 days of its receipt, the offer will be deemed accepted, and the Agreement, as amended, will take effect at the end of the Current Term. Seller will send Buyer a service confirmation letter after the 10 days have expired. If Seller does not submit a Pricing Notice, then this Agreement will renew automatically on a month to month term and your rate will be Index Price (defined in Section 4) plus an adder per therm. This Agreement may be terminated by Buyer or Seller at the end of the Current Term by providing written notice to the other party 60 days prior to the end of the Current Term.
3. Supplier's and Utility's Role: Seller agrees to sell to Buyer and deliver to the Utility, and Buyer agrees to purchase from Seller and receive from the Utility, Buyer's full requirements of natural gas for the accounts listed on the Enrollment Form ("Accounts").

| :--: | :--: |
| Fixed Rate ${ }^{1,2}$ | The natural gas supply price will remain fixed for the Initial Term. |
| Index Rate ${ }^{2}$ | Buyer's natural gas supply price will be the Index Price plus an adder per therm. |
| Guaranteed Savings/Fixed Winter Rate ${ }^{1,2}$ | The natural gas supply price is fixed November through April.

| NYMEX Rate ${ }^{2}$ | Buyer's natural gas supply price will be the NYMEX Price plus an adder per therm. |

${ }^{1}$ Specific Price: Rate Plans marked with a ${ }^{1}$ indicate plans for which Buyer may indicate a Specific Price on the Enrollment Form. A Specific Price may not be available to Buyer if (i) Buyer is a current customer on a Rate Plan other than the Index Rate, (ii) the Index Price defined above has increased, or (iii) there is an error on the Enrollment Form because the Specific Price (a) applies to a different Term, (b) it is not available to Buyer based on Buyer's forecasted use, or (c) it was never available from Seller for the Term set forth on the Enrollment Form. If a Specific Price selection is not available, this Agreement is void and Seller will inform Buyer and provide Buyer with the opportunity to enroll under the terms of then-available Rate Plans. For a Specific Price to be available, it must be a valid and current Specific Price as determined by Seller in its sole discretion.
${ }^{2}$ Administrative, Miscellaneous and Other Charges: In addition to the price under the Rate, some miscellaneous, storage, pooling and administrative charges may apply and be billed by the Utility: (i) if Buyer is a customer of Nicor Gas, such charges will appear on the bill under "Administrative \& Miscellaneous"; or (ii) if Buyer is a customer of Peoples Gas, such charges will appear on the bill under 'Storage Bal. and/or Pool Chg" and/or "Misc Credits/Debits". If the pass-through charges from the Utility increase or if new charges are approved by a governmental agency with jurisdiction and passed through, existing tariff charges are administered differently and the pass-through charges from the Utility increase, the applicable administrative, miscellaneous and other Charges will increase accordingly. The Rate does not include Taxes (as defined below) or Utility distribution charges.
5. Taxes: Buyer is responsible for all state and local sales, use, revenue, gross receipts, commercial activity, excise and/or ad valorem tax (collectively, "Taxes") and shall reimburse Seller if Seller is required to remit such Taxes in connection with this Agreement.
6. Limited Availability: Seller's acceptance of this Agreement is subject to credit approval and successful enrollment with the utility. The Rate selected may have limited availability and Seller may reject enrollment based on availability in its sole discretion. Seller will notify Buyer by mail to confirm Seller's acceptance.
7. Termination; Remedies: (a) This Agreement will automatically terminate or Buyer may terminate the Agreement without penalty if (i) the requested

service location is not served by the Utility or (ii) Buyer moves outside the Utility service area or to an area not served by Seller.
(b) This Agreement will terminate upon written notice, but without penalty to Buyer if, (i) the Choice program is no longer available due to a change in regulation, tariff, or law, or (ii) Seller defaults, which includes, an unexcused failure to deliver natural gas under the terms of this Agreement.
(c) An "Early Termination" shall occur if this Agreement is terminated (i) by Buyer to select a different price or Rate Plan prior to the end of the current term or (ii) by Seller or the Utility due to Buyer's default, which includes a failure to pay or an unexcused failure to receive natural gas under the terms of this Agreement.
(d) The Parties agree that actual damages are difficult or impossible to ascertain, and that the remedies described in this Section are reasonable estimates of the actual damages incurred and not penalties. Buyer agrees to pay Seller for Early Termination within ten (10) calendar days of the invoice date to the payment address noted on the invoice, or as otherwise agreed upon by Buyer and Seller.
(e) Late payments incur interest at $1.5 \%$ per month (or the highest amount allowed by law) plus any credit and collection costs incurred by Seller.
(f) RESIDENTIAL AND SMALL COMMERCIAL CUSTOMERS ONLY: If Buyer is a Residential Customer or a Small Commercial Customer and an Early Termination occurs Buyer agrees to pay an early termination fee equal to $\$ 50$. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Buyer is a Residential Customer or a Small Commercial Customer, Buyer may terminate this agreement within ten (10) business days of Buyer's first invoice without incurring an early termination fee.
(g) LARGE COMMERCIAL CUSTOMERS ONLY: If Buyer is a Large Commercial Customer (defined below), and an Early Termination occurs in connection with a Rate Plan without a Specific Price, then Seller's exclusive remedy is $\$ 100.00$. If Buyer is a Large Commercial Customer, and an Early Termination occurs in connection with a Rate Plan with a Specific Price selected and an Early Termination occurs, then Seller's exclusive remedy is an Early Termination fee that is calculated as the positive difference between the price under the Rate, less the 'price at resale', multiplied by the unused forecasted quantity for the remainder of the Term. Seller shall determine the unused forecasted quantity based on historic usage. The 'price at resale' is the price Seller determines in a commercially reasonable manner that it could resell the unused forecasted quantity, provided however Seller shall not be required to resell gas in order to determine such price. A Large Commercial Customer is defined as a non-residential retail customer of a natural gas utility that consumed more than 5,000 therms of natural gas during the previous year.

If Buyer is currently under contract with an alternative gas supplier, Buyer may incur fees from such supplier when service is established with Seller.
10. Force Majeure: Except for Buyer's obligation to pay Seller timely, neither Party shall be liable to the other for failure to perform an obligation if such failure was caused by any event beyond the reasonable control of the non-performing party, that could not be remedied by the exercise of due diligence and that was not reasonably foreseeable, including without limitation, acts of God, interruption of utility service, terrorist acts or wars, or force majeure events of the Utility. Seller may return Buyer to Utility service upon notification of a Force Majeure event preventing performance.
