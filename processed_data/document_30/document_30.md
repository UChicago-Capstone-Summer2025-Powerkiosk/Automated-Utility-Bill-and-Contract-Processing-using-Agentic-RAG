Demand Charges
In addition to energy charges, some commercial customers may pay demand charges. The metered power demand, measured in kilowatts (kW), for any month is the highest average during any 30-minute period. Only customers who have demands of 50kW or greater are billed a separate demand charge. For natural gas customers, maximum daily demand is identified as the maximum use in 24-hour period during the current bill cycle.
