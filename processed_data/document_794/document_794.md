# Notice to Customers on Standard Offer Generation Service 

Be aware that the service you are currently receiving from your distribution company is "standard offer generation service," the rate for which has been approved by the Department of Telecommunications and Energy and which, subject to adjustment for potential developments such as inflation, must result in a 10\% discount from the rate in effect during August 1997. You may remain on this service until the end of February 2005. Should you choose to receive service from a competitive supplier rather than your distribution company prior to February 2005, you will not be eligible to return to standard offer generation service unless you qualify as a low-income customer or you have notified your distribution company, prior to February 28, 1999 and within 120 days (180 days if you are receiving service through a public aggregator) of when you first received competitive service, of your desire to return to standard offer generation service.

Please contact your local utility for a complete explanation of any applicable connection, re-connection or termination procedures or fees, including, but not limited to, entry or reentry fees, off-cycle meter reading fees, exit fees, or early cancellation fees or penalties; any fee charged by a distribution company when a consumer changes to another retail seller of electricity; any fee prescribed by the Department; and any other fee that may be charged to a consumer and which is required to be disclosed pursuant to M.G.L. c. $164, \S 1 F(5)(1)$

# Terms and Conditions 

## Massachusetts Commercial Electricity Fixed Full

1. Agreement to Sell and Purchase Energy. This is an agreement between Agera Energy LLC ("Agera"), a licensed Competitive Supplier, and the undersigned customer ("Customer") under which Customer shall initiate electricity service and begin enrollment with Agera (the "Agreement"). Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Agera agrees to sell and deliver, and Customer agrees to purchase and accept the quantity of electricity, as estimated by Agera, necessary to meet Customer's requirements based upon consumption data obtained by Agera or the delivery schedule of the Local Distribution Utility (the "LDC"). Agera is not affiliated with and does not represent the LDC. The amount of electricity supplied under this Agreement is subject to change based upon data reflecting Customer's consumption obtained by Agera or the LDC's delivery schedule. The LDC will continue to deliver the electricity supplied by Agera.
2. Term. The Term is set forth on the Customer Disclosure Label.

At least 30 days and no more than 60 days prior to the renewal date, Agera will notify Customers in writing of the terms of renewal of this Agreement and the Customer's right to renew, reject or renegotiate the Agreement. While receiving service on a month-to-month basis, such notification will be provided only for the first renewal occurring at the end of the term, and Customer or Agera may cancel or terminate this Agreement by providing 15 days advance written notice of termination to the other party.

For all "Dual Billing" options, customer will receive a bill for delivery costs from the LDC and a bill from Agera for energy-related costs.
