Acconym/Term,Meaning
MPAN,Meter Point Administration Number - a 13 digit unique reference for your supply point.
SSC,Standard Settlement Configuration - for meters that do not take half hourly measurements of consumption this is a 4 digit code that represents the periods of use that your meter is capable of measuring. This will not be displayed for half hourly meters.
Site,A geographic location in the United Kingdom.
Price Group,"A grouping of the supplies for which you are being provided a quotation based on their sharing the same pricing template, rate structure and energy content."
Offered Rates,These are the rates that are being offered to you.
Passed Through Charges,"These are rates that we are either directly charged for your supply (e.g. Distribution costs) or are charged on billed values (e.g. CCL and VAT). These charges will be passed onto you and charged in addition to the ""Offered Rates""."
Est Reconciled PT,Estimated Reconciled Passed-Through Charges - these are Pass-Through charges for which the
Charges,"amount is not known until after the event e.g. TNUoS TRIAD rates. We will charge an estimated amount, based on your forecast usage, up until the actual amount is known and at this point a reconciliation will be performed. The difference between the estimated charges that have been charged up until this point and the actual amount due is calculated by the reconciliation and is then included on your next bill."
Estimated Annual Cons (kWh),An estimate of the amount of electricity that will be used over the next annual period.

Grid Supply Point,The term Grid Supply Point relates to the volume of electricity that needs to be delivered to the grid supply point in order to then be distributed to your supply to provide the metering point consumption. The Grid Supply Point consumption is the sum of the Metering Point consumption and distribution losses.
Notional Balancing Point,"The term Notional Balancing Point relates to the volume of electricity that needs to be generated in order to transmit and distribute the electricity to supply and provide the Metering Point consumption. The Notional Balancing Point consumption is the sum of the Metering Point consumption, distribution losses and transmission losses."
