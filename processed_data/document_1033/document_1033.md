# Master Energy Purchase Agreement - Electric Commodity Sales 

(Commercial GTC v.05.02.19)

This Master Energy Purchase Agreement - Electric Commodity Sales, which comprises the below General Terms and Conditions (the "General Terms and Conditions") dated and effective as of 11/20/2020 and all schedules, attachments, riders, and exhibits hereto, including any Attachment A-1 (each, an "Attachment" and collectively, this "Agreement"), is entered into by and between AEP Energy, Inc. ("AEP Energy") and Cahokia Illinois School District 187 ("Customer") (each of AEP Energy and Customer referred to individually as a "Party" and collectively as the "Parties") and is intended to govern the purchase and sale of Retail Energy (as hereinafter defined) between the Parties for Customer's account(s) (which may include non-metered lighting accounts) specified on any Attachment (each, a "Service Location").

## General Terms and Conditions

## I. PURCHASE AND SALE OF RETAIL ENERGY

During the relevant Term (as hereinafter defined) and unless excused by a Force Majeure, AEP Energy shall sell to Customer the commodity portion of its retail electric requirements at each Service Location, and Customer shall exclusively purchase from AEP Energy and take delivery of, all of its retail electric generation supply requirements at each such Service Location (the "Retail Energy"), the terms and conditions of which are described in the relevant Attachment(s). The Retail Energy shall be provided to Customer's relevant electric distribution company (each as specified in the relevant Attachment, the "EDC") and transmission system interconnection point (each, a "Delivery Point"). The EDC is responsible for delivery of the Retail Energy to any Service Location at and from the Delivery Point, as well as for reading Customer's meter and responding to emergencies. The delivery and metering of the Retail Energy is subject to the applicable terms and conditions of the EDC. Customer designates AEP Energy as an authorized recipient of Customer's account, billing, and historical and ongoing usage information and consents to the disclosure by the EDC to AEP Energy of certain basic information about Customer and each Service Location, including: account number, meter number, meter read data, rate class, billing and payment information, account name, service address, billing address, and telephone number. Customer is solely responsible for payment of all charges or costs related to the EDC's delivery or distribution of the Retail Energy to Customer and other services, whether billed to AEP Energy or Customer, including any switching, telecommunications, and/or meter or meter reading related costs.
The Retail Energy pricing specified in any Attachment is determined by AEP Energy using Customer's actual and estimated historical and forecasted load data, which is considered representative of each Service Location's anticipated Retail Energy requirements for the Term, and applies to all Retail Energy covered under the relevant Attachment, including any unmetered lighting volumes. With respect to any pricing, or a factor of the pricing, in any Attachment based (in whole or part) upon a specified index, any such reference, publication (in whole or part), or entity responsible for the publication of the price source includes any successor thereto.

## II. BILLING AND PAYMENT

A. General Billing and Payment Terms: AEP Energy or the relevant EDC shall provide monthly invoices related to the sold Retail Energy, based on the relevant EDC's meter read cycle, in accordance with the billing method specified in the relevant Attachment, (1) as a single bill through utility/EDC consolidated billing (UCB), (2) through supplier consolidated billing (SCB), or (3)
as a separate bill from each of AEP Energy and the relevant EDC (Dual Bill); provided, however, the relevant EDC may convert or alter the invoicing method from time to time as it so requires. AEP Energy will send SCB or Dual Bill invoices via the first available method (listed in order of priority): (1) the billing email address stated in the "Customer information" table at the end of these General Terms and Conditions (unless Customer requests paper bills) or later specified by Customer in writing (including email), (2) the billing mailing address stated in such table or later specified by Customer in writing (including email), or (3) the physical address of any Service Location. AEP Energy may itemize or summarize invoices according to the various cost components (e.g., capacity or transmission) related to the Retail Energy and shall provide all further reasonable billing detail to Customer upon request. AEP Energy has the right to estimate bills in cases where actual billing determinants are unavailable. In cases where estimated bills are issued, AEP Energy shall subsequently reconcile the actual bill(s) and the estimated bill(s) and post any debit or credit amount to Customer's account. Customer shall pay all amounts due according to the instructions on the relevant invoice by payment in check or wire transfer of immediately available funds or via Automated Clearinghouse, such that AEP Energy will have received such payment not later than the close of business on the business day following the number of calendar days specified in the relevant Attachment from the date of the invoice containing the relevant charges. Late payments with respect to any and all amounts due and payable to AEP Energy (including any outstanding late payment charges and Settlement Amount(s) (as hereinafter defined), collectively, "Account Charges") shall incur interest charges at a rate of interest equal to one and one-half percent (1.5\%) per month or the maximum allowed under applicable law, whichever is less, and continue to accrue until all such amounts are paid in full. In any instance where any payment is declined by the issuing institution, Customer shall be assessed a charge of fortyfive dollars ( $\$ 45$ ) or the maximum allowed under applicable law (whichever is less) per declined payment. Customer shall be liable for all costs incurred by AEP Energy, including attorneys' fees, in connection with collection and enforcement of its rights on past due Account Charges.
B. Invoice Disputes and Adjustments: Customer may, in good faith, dispute in writing the correctness of any invoice rendered under this Agreement with respect to amounts due to AEP Energy by (1) delivering to AEP Energy written notice of the dispute, which must include the amount of, and reasonably sufficient basis for, the disputed amount and all reasonable supporting documentation (the "Notice of Dispute") and (2) making payment of the undisputed portion of the invoice within the normal terms, prior to the due date of the relevant invoice. During the forty-five (45) calendar days following AEP Energy's receipt of any Notice of Dispute (the "Dispute Period"), the Parties shall expeditiously and in good faith negotiate to resolve any disputed invoice. If the Parties are unable to mutually resolve in writing such dispute before expiration of the Dispute Period, either Party may exercise any remedy available to it at law or in equity pursuant to this Agreement. Customer must dispute charges strictly in accordance with the terms of this paragraph or it will be deemed to have waived its rights to dispute such charges. AEP Energy may at any time adjust and re-issue any previously-issued invoice to reflect Customer's actual usage and charges during the billing period covered therein, irrespective of whether Customer had previously paid the previously-issued invoice, and Customer will receive credit in such re-issued invoices

for any amount of the previously-issued invoice that had been paid by Customer.

## III. TERM AND EFFECT OF TERMINATION

Should the Parties reach agreement regarding a Retail Energy purchase and sale transaction under this Agreement, the Parties shall execute an Attachment, which will include, as applicable: (A) the identification of Service Location(s), (B) the term, (C) Retail Energy pricing and related provisions, (D) delivery quantity, and (E) other special terms and conditions, if any. This Agreement is effective as of the date hereof, and will remain in effect for so long as any Attachment remains outstanding or, if applicable, until the conclusion of any Holdover Term or Renewal Term (each as hereinafter defined) (the "Term"). The Parties agree that the EDC determines when Customer will be switched to AEP Energy for its Retail Energy supply, and that such switch will occur in accordance with the EDC's rules and practices regarding such switching. AEP Energy, therefore, shall use commercially reasonable efforts to begin supplying Retail Energy to Customer under the relevant Attachment (1) on the available enrollment date that is established by the EDC and estimated to be on or around the Anticipated Start Date specified in the relevant Attachment, and (2) after AEP Energy receives confirmation that the EDC has accepted the delivery service request (the "Commencement Date"); provided, however, that in no event shall the Commencement Date be fewer than three (3) calendar days following execution of the relevant Attachment. AEP Energy shall not be liable for any lost savings or lost opportunity as a result of any delay in any Commencement Date.
Not less than thirty (30) calendar days prior to the then-current expiration date of the relevant Term, AEP Energy may provide written notice ("Renewal Notice") to Customer of AEP Energy's intent to extend such Term ("Renewal Term"). Any Renewal Notice shall contain AEP Energy's proposed changes, amendments, deletions, or additions to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including with regard to fees, charges, and the Renewal Term ("Renewal Amendments"). Customer shall have five (5) business days to reject in writing the Renewal Notice. Customer's failure to reject any Renewal Notice in writing within five (5) business days shall result in all Renewal Amendments, including the Renewal Term, being deemed to have been irrevocably and unconditionally agreed to by Customer.
Following termination or expiration of the relevant Term, AEP Energy may continue to supply Retail Energy under this Agreement to any Service Location on a month-to-month holdover basis (each, a "Holdover Term"). The price payable during any Holdover Term shall be the applicable Regional Transmission Organization ("RTO") EDC day ahead hourly locational marginal price (LMP) plus an adder of $\$ 0.01$ per kWh , and any and all applicable bypassable costs, charges, and fees for capacity, transmission, line losses, ancillary services, renewable portfolio standards (RPS), taxes, and any other related penalties, fees, charges, expenses, and other costs to serve incurred by AEP Energy of every kind and nature shall be passed through in a commercially reasonable manner to Customer with no additional mark-up. In cases where Customer's EDC does not provide interval usage data, AEP Energy shall, using commercially reasonable methodologies, estimate the load weighted average of the applicable LMP. Either Party may at any time terminate the Holdover Term and return any Service Location to the EDC without penalty or prejudice.
In the event of termination as provided in this Agreement, all further obligations of the Parties under this Agreement shall terminate without further liability of the Parties, except for the payment by the owing Party of any sums due and owing to the other Party related to performance delivered prior to termination, whether or not then invoiced, including any further Account Charges. Any other obligation or agreement hereunder which by its nature survives, shall survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement,
including the Parties' respective agreements and obligations under the "Confidentiality," "Title, Indemnification, Warranty, and Limitation of Liability," and "Governing Law, Venue, and Waiver of Jury Trial" sections, and shall apply whether in contract, equity, tort, or otherwise. Such termination shall, with respect to each Service Location, be effective on the next available drop date as established by the EDC. In the event that the EDC's retail electric supply choice program is terminated or materially changed in any manner prior to the end of the Term, AEP Energy may terminate the relevant Attachment(s), or, if applicable, this Agreement, without penalty to either Party.

## IV. CREDIT

Each Party represents that there is no bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, or other similar proceeding pending or being contemplated by it or, to its knowledge, threatened against it. Customer agrees to provide commercially reasonable credit information upon request. Should the creditworthiness or financial responsibility of Customer become unsatisfactory to AEP Energy at any time during the Term, as determined by AEP Energy in its commercially reasonable discretion, AEP Energy may request additional credit information, including financial statements in accordance with the previous sentence, and in addition thereto, require that Customer deliver to AEP Energy, as security, adequate assurance of performance, including credit support in such form and amount as AEP Energy may in its discretion require, including a parental guaranty or letter of credit from a creditworthy entity in each case acceptable to AEP Energy, deposit, or prepayment ("Adequate Assurance of Performance"). Upon receipt of such request from AEP Energy, Customer shall have five (5) business days to provide the requested information and/or Adequate Assurance of Performance to AEP Energy.

## V. EVENTS OF DEFAULT

A. Definition: An "Event of Default" shall mean, with respect to the Party to which the following applies (the "Defaulting Party"), the occurrence of any of the following: (1) the failure of such Party to make, when due, any payment required pursuant to this Agreement if such failure is not remedied within three (3) business days after written notice and demand for payment; (2) any representation or warranty made by such Party herein being false or misleading in any material respect when made or ceases to remain true (and which (if capable of being excused or remedied) is not remedied within fifteen (15) calendar days after written notice) during any Term; (3) the failure of such Party to perform any material covenant or obligation set forth in this Agreement, including any unexcused failure to deliver or take any quantity of Retail Energy under this Agreement, and such failure is not excused pursuant to Force Majeure (as hereinafter defined) or remedied within fifteen (15) calendar days after written notice; (4) either Party, or the entity providing Adequate Assurance of Performance, disaffirms, disclaims, repudiates, or rejects, in whole or in part, or challenges the validity of, this Agreement, any Attachment or transaction entered into pursuant to this Agreement, or any Adequate Assurance of Performance issued in connection with this Agreement; (5) AEP Energy's receipt of notice from any EDC or Customer of Customer's effective or intended termination of supply with AEP Energy at any Service Location prior to the end of the term of the relevant Attachment; (6) Customer (A) files a petition or otherwise commences, authorizes, or acquiesces in the commencement of a proceeding or cause of action under any bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, or similar law, or has any such petition filed or proceeding commenced against it, (B) makes an assignment or any general arrangement for the benefit of creditors, (C) otherwise becomes bankrupt or insolvent (however evidenced), or (D) has a liquidator, administrator, receiver, trustee, conservator, or similar official appointed with respect to it or any portion of its property or assets, regardless of whether such

appointment is made in connection with a bankruptcy proceeding or reorganization for the benefit of creditors; (7) the occurrence of any event of default with respect to Customer under any other agreement between the Parties, including any Master Energy Purchase Agreement - Natural Gas Commodity Sales, NAESB Base Contract for Sale and Purchase of Natural Gas, or other agreement for, or in support of, the purchase and sale of retail energy; or (8) the failure of Customer to deliver requested information and/or to deliver, and/or cause to be delivered, Adequate Assurance of Performance or otherwise satisfy the creditworthiness requirements under the "Credit" section.
B. Suspension and Early Termination: If an Event of Default occurs, the Party that is not the Defaulting Party (the "NonDefaulting Party") may, at its option and in its sole discretion, take any one or more of the following actions: (1) suspend its performance under this Agreement; (2) terminate this Agreement (including any or all Attachments hereunder) by sending written notice to the Defaulting Party; or (3) exercise such other rights and remedies as may be available to it at law or in equity pursuant to this Agreement. In the event of such suspension or an early termination, Customer shall pay to AEP Energy all amounts owed under this Agreement, including amounts owed for delivered performance, whether or not then invoiced. In the event of such an early termination, (i) AEP Energy shall return the relevant Service Location(s) to the EDC effective on the next available drop date as established by such EDC and (ii) the Defaulting Party shall also pay to the Non-Defaulting Party as liquidated damages a termination payment amount (the "Settlement Amount") calculated as follows:

- For purposes of calculating any Settlement Amount, Customer's "Historical Annual Usage" is equal to the number of megawatt hours (MWhs) used by Customer at the terminated Service Location(s) in the preceding twelve (12) months.
- If Customer's Historical Annual Usage is less than or equal to fifty (50) MWhs, the Settlement Amount shall be equal to the number of months remaining in the Term multiplied by ten dollars ( $\$ 10$ ). For example, if this Agreement is terminated two (2) months early, two (2) months $x$ ten dollars ( $\$ 10$ ) per month $=$ twenty dollar ( $\$ 20$ ) Settlement Amount.
- If Customer's Historical Annual Usage is greater than fifty (50) MWhs but less than or equal to two hundred-fifty (250) MWhs, the Settlement Amount shall be equal to the number of months remaining in the Term multiplied by fifty dollars ( $\$ 50$ ). For example, if this Agreement is terminated two (2) months early, two (2) months $x$ fifty dollars ( $\$ 50$ ) per month $=$ one hundred dollar ( $\$ 100$ ) Settlement Amount.
- If Customer's Historical Annual Usage is greater than two hundredfifty (250) MWhs but less than or equal to five hundred (500) MWhs, the Settlement Amount shall be equal to the number of months remaining in the Term multiplied by one hundred-fifty dollars ( $\$ 150$ ). For example, if this Agreement is terminated two (2) months early, two (2) months $x$ one hundred-fifty dollars ( $\$ 150$ ) per month $=$ three hundred dollar ( $\$ 300$ ) Settlement Amount.
- If Customer's Historical Annual Usage is greater than five hundred (500) MWhs, the Settlement Amount shall be equal to (a) Contract Value minus Wholesale Market Value (If Customer is the Defaulting Party) or (b) Retail Market Value minus Contract Value (if AEP Energy is the Defaulting Party); provided, however, that no such Settlement Amount shall be due to a Party under this section if such Party is the Defaulting Party.
As used herein, the following terms shall have the following meanings:
"Contract Value" means the amount that would have been owed by Customer related to the Remaining Performance (as hereinafter defined) pursuant to the applicable Attachment(s).
"Retail Market Value" means what Customer is actually paying, so long as no more than is commercially reasonable, related to the Remaining Performance.
"Remaining Performance" means the amount of Retail Energy expected to be supplied by AEP Energy during the remainder of the relevant Term had it not been terminated early.
"Wholesale Market Value" means the value that AEP Energy accrues in reallocating, terminating, or liquidating any portion of any energy supply contract, hedge, or related trading position or arrangement held by or for AEP Energy, or in avoiding any cost, in the case of any cost component (e.g., capacity or transmission), related to the Remaining Performance. For the avoidance of doubt, AEP Energy shall not be required to enter into a replacement transaction(s) in order to determine the Wholesale Market Value.
The Non-Defaulting Party shall calculate the Settlement Amount in its commercially reasonable discretion, including, where applicable, its estimates of market prices and forward market prices. Such Settlement Amount calculation shall be made available to the Defaulting Party upon written request. The Settlement Amount shall be paid by the Defaulting Party to the Non-Defaulting Party within five (5) business days after notice of the Settlement Amount due and owing to the Non-Defaulting Party. The Parties acknowledge and agree that the Settlement Amount constitutes a reasonable approximation of harm or loss, is a fair and reasonable method of estimating damages that a Party will suffer or incur in such a case in the light of the anticipated or actual harm caused by the termination or suspension, the difficulties of proof of loss, and the inconvenience or non-feasibility of otherwise obtaining an adequate remedy, and is not a penalty or punitive in any respect but is reasonable compensation for a Party's damages.


## VI. SERVICE LOCATION CLOSURE

Customer shall provide AEP Energy at least thirty (30) calendar days' prior written notice prior to terminating supply at any Service Location, including as a result of ceasing operations at such Service Location, closing any Service Location, or the sale of any Service Location to an unrelated third party. Customer shall be responsible for payment of damages incurred by AEP Energy, if any, relating to or arising from any such termination of supply. Such damages shall be calculated in the same manner as the Settlement Amount as if Customer is the Defaulting Party. The Parties acknowledge and agree that the pricing included in the relevant Attachment reflects, among other factors, Customer's expected usage and EDC-specific pricing under such Attachment. In the event that Customer does not pay AEP Energy for related damages owed in accordance with this section, AEP Energy reserves the right to adjust, in its commercially reasonable discretion, the pricing for any remaining Service Location(s) based on the remaining estimated usage. The Parties' obligations under this Agreement will continue in full force and effect for any remaining Service Location(s) on the relevant Attachment.

## VII. RELATIONSHIP OF PARTIES

The relationship between the Parties is that of independent contractors for the sale and purchase of Retail Energy, and nothing in this Agreement establishes a joint venture, fiduciary relationship, partnership, other joint undertaking, or any other relationship or imposes a trust or partnership duty, obligation, or liability on either Party. Customer acknowledges that, other than those representations contained in this Agreement, it has not relied on any representation, communication (written or oral), or omission by AEP Energy in entering into this Agreement or any Attachment, including in evaluating the advantages or disadvantages of any specific product or service or predictions about savings, future energy prices, or any other matter. Customer acknowledges that the EDC's standard offer service rates generally change from time to time and therefore AEP Energy does not provide any guarantee of savings in comparison to the EDC's standard offer service rates. If Customer received price comparison(s) in connection with this Agreement, by

entry into this Agreement, Customer understands and agrees that it has been informed, prior to its entry into this Agreement, that no guarantee of savings is being provided. If a property management company or agent ("Agent") is acting and executing on behalf of the owner of any Service Location (the "Owner"), Agent represents and warrants that it has the full and complete authority to execute and bind the Owner to this Agreement and that the term of such granted authority from the Owner does not expire or terminate prior to the end of the Term. Customer agrees and acknowledges that any agent, broker, consultant, or other third party involved in any solicitation or transaction hereunder ("ABC") serves as an agent of Customer during such sales process and may receive a commission to be paid by AEP Energy from payments received from Customer hereunder.

## VIII. ASSIGNMENT

This Agreement shall be binding on and inure to the benefit of each Party's successors and permitted assigns. Neither Party shall assign this Agreement or its rights hereunder without the prior written consent of the other Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed; provided, however, that without such consent, but with prior written notice, either Party may assign its rights and obligations under this Agreement to an affiliate or transfer this Agreement to any successor acquiring all or substantially all of the assets of such Party, or with respect to AEP Energy all or substantially all of the retail electric supply business of AEP Energy, so long as (1) with respect to Customer, such affiliate or successor, as applicable, (A) is reasonably determined by AEP Energy to be of similar or greater credit quality as compared to Customer and able to perform Customer's obligations hereunder and (B) delivers such enforceability assurances as AEP Energy reasonably requests and (2) with respect to AEP Energy, such affiliate or successor is contractually obligated to continue to supply Customer at the Retail Energy pricing specified in the relevant existing Attachment(s).
IX. FORCE MAJEURE

Neither Party shall be required to perform or fulfill its obligations (other than such Party's obligation to make payment(s) then due or becoming due with respect to delivered performance prior to a Force Majeure) under this Agreement so long as and to the extent a Party (the "Claiming Party") is prevented by Force Majeure from carrying out, in whole or part, its obligations under this Agreement and such Claiming Party gives notice to the other Party as soon as practicable after it has actual, or reasonably should have had constructive, knowledge of such Force Majeure. "Force Majeure" shall mean an event or circumstance that (A) prevents the Claiming Party from performing its obligations; (B) cannot be reasonably overcome or avoided; (C) is beyond the Claiming Party's reasonable control; and (D) does not result from the Claiming Party's fault, negligence, or particular economic circumstances, including, to the extent satisfying the foregoing requirements, acts of God; landslides; lightning; fire; storms or storm warnings; flood; weather related events affecting an entire geographic region, such as low temperatures that cause failure of transmission or distribution systems; terrorism; sabotage; breach by the EDC; electric grid interruption and/or curtailment; earthquake; war; riot or other civil unrest; or requirements, actions, or failure to act on the part of governmental authorities, including actions such as necessity for compliance with any court order, law, statute, ordinance, regulation, or policy having the effect of law promulgated by a governmental authority having jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the foregoing in this section, in no event will Force Majeure be, or will the applicable Party's performance be excused, based on economic hardship of either Party, including a Party's ability to purchase or sell, as applicable, Retail Energy at a price more advantageous than the price under the relevant Attachment, or with respect to Customer, the loss or failure of Customer's facilities or Customer's inability to
use Retail Energy purchased hereunder. If the Force Majeure continues for a period in excess of thirty (30) calendar days, then the non-Claiming Party may terminate this Agreement by providing the other Party written notice of the early termination, without such termination constituting an Event of Default.

## X. REGULATORY EVENT

In the event that any new, or any change in any existing, law, statute, rule, regulation, order, decision (including any judgment or judicial decision), decree, tariff, charge, or rate class, or process, practice, procedure, protocol, design, or structure, or other event, including any change in any formula rate calculation or charge (e.g., any increase in the rate for network integration transmission service or capacity by the EDC, RTO, or Independent System Operator (ISO), as applicable), or any change in any interpretation or application of any of the foregoing, by any governmental authority, court, EDC, ISO, RTO, or other regulated service provider materially alters to the detriment of AEP Energy its costs to perform or its economic returns under this Agreement (a "Regulatory Event"), AEP Energy may pass through such cost or economic effect to Customer to eliminate the impact of such Regulatory Event, and all other terms and conditions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. For the purposes of a Regulatory Event, "material" means a change that results in an increase in the relevant Retail Energy pricing under the relevant Attachment for the remainder of the relevant Term by $\$ 0.10$ per MWh or more.

## XI.

## FORWARD CONTRACT

The Parties agree that (A) this Agreement constitutes a "forward contract" within the meaning of Section 101(25) of Title 11 of the United States Code (as amended, the "Bankruptcy Code"), and for all purposes under the Bankruptcy Code; (B) AEP Energy constitutes a "forward contract merchant" within the meaning of Section 101(26) of the Bankruptcy Code and for all purposes under the Bankruptcy Code; (C) AEP Energy is acting as a "forward contract merchant" in connection with this Agreement; and (D) all payments made by Customer to AEP Energy hereunder shall constitute "settlement payments" within the meaning of Section 101(51A) of the Bankruptcy Code and for purposes of all forward contract provisions in the Bankruptcy Code.

## XII. CONFIDENTIALITY

Both Parties agree to keep confidential the terms and conditions of this Agreement and each proposed or consummated transaction and Attachment hereunder, including price, product specifications, and quantity information, except for any required disclosure to any regulatory body, governmental entity, or agency having jurisdiction, any disclosure reasonably necessary to enforce the terms of this Agreement, or any disclosure to any accountant, attorney, or other professional acting on behalf of or representing the receiving Party, any ABC, or any affiliated or third-party agent, advisor, or contractor implementing this Agreement or the purposes hereof.

## XIII. TITLE, INDEMNIFICATION, WARRANTY, AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

Title to and control and possession of the Retail Energy shall pass from AEP Energy to Customer at the Delivery Point. AEP Energy shall have and assume responsibility for any injury, loss, expense, penalty, liability, damage, or loss (each, a "Liability") with respect to, and shall defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Customer against all claims and Liabilities, including attorneys' fees (collectively, "Claims"), arising from, the Retail Energy prior to its delivery to the relevant Delivery Point, and Customer shall have and assume responsibility for any Liability with respect to, and shall defend, indemnify, and hold harmless AEP Energy against all Claims arising from, the Retail Energy at and after the relevant Delivery Point, in each case, with respect to each Party, except to the extent such Claims and/or Liabilities arise out of the indemnified Party's negligence or breach of this Agreement. AEP Energy warrants title to all Retail Energy at the Delivery Point delivered hereunder and

sells such Retail Energy to Customer free from liens and adverse claims. THIS IS AEP ENERGY'S ONLY WARRANTY CONCERNING THE RETAIL ENERGY PROVIDED HEREUNDER AND IS MADE EXPRESSLY IN LIEU OF ALL OTHER WARRANTIES AND REPRESENTATIONS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, MERCHANTABILITY, OR OTHERWISE EXCEPT AS PART OF ANY PAYMENT OF THE SETTLEMENT AMOUNT OR OTHERWISE AS EXPRESSLY PERMITTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS HEREOF, NEITHER PARTY SHALL BE RESPONSIBLE UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, LOST PROFITS, OR OTHER BUSINESS INTERRUPTION DAMAGES, BY STATUTE, IN TORT OR CONTRACT OR OTHERWISE. IN ADDITION, AEP ENERGY'S AGGREGATE LIABILITY UNDER THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE LIMITED TO AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO THE TOTAL OF THE AEP ENERGY CHARGES CONTAINED IN THE FIRST TWO INVOICES REFLECTING THE ENERGY COST SPECIFIC TO CUSTOMER'S METER READS AS THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY, AND ALL OTHER REMEDIES OR DAMAGES AT LAW OR IN EQUITY ARE EXPRESSLY WAIVED. NOTWITHSTANDING WHETHER THE RETAIL ENERGY SOLD HEREUNDER MEETS THE DEFINITION OF A "GOOD" UNDER THE APPLICABLE UNIFORM COMMERCIAL CODE OF THE GOVERNING LAW, THE PARTIES AGREE THAT ARTICLE 2 OF THE UNIFORM COMMERCIAL CODE SHALL APPLY TO THE TERMS OF THIS TRANSACTION AS IF THE RETAIL ENERGY SOLD HEREUNDER WERE A "GOOD."

## XIV. NOTICES

Any notice served hereunder from AEP Energy to Customer, shall be in writing and sent to any of Customer's billing or notice address or email address specified in writing by Customer from time to time, the address of any Service Location, or the address to which bills are sent to Customer. Any notice served hereunder from Customer to AEP Energy shall be in writing and shall be delivered to AEP Energy, Inc., Attn: Legal Department, 225 West Wacker Drive, Suite 600, Chicago, IL 60605 or such other address specified in writing by AEP Energy from time to time as the notice address. In the absence of proof of actual receipt, notice shall be deemed to have been received (A) if by email, on the close of the business day on which it was transmitted, (B) if by overnight mail or courier, on the next business day after it was sent, or (C) if by first class mail, on the fifth (5 ${ }^{\text {th }}$ ) business day after mailing, each as established by business records or any other commercially reasonable evidence. Customer shall be responsible for communicating to AEP Energy any changes to Customer's billing, notice, or email address, ownership, business name, telephone number, contact person, or meter number(s) for each Service Location as soon as practicable but in any event no later than fifteen (15) calendar days after any such change takes effect. Customer affirms its agreement that AEP Energy and entities calling on AEP Energy's behalf may make calls to the number(s) Customer has provided, or will provide during the Term, regarding Customer's account(s), including about amounts due. By providing AEP Energy Customer's email address, Customer agrees to receive notices electronically, where permitted under applicable law.

## XV. GOVERNING LAW, VENUE, AND WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL

This Agreement, with respect to any Service Location, shall be governed by, and construed and enforced exclusively in accordance with, the laws of the state where such Service Location is located, without regard to its choice of law provisions. Each Party expressly waives its rights as a consumer under any law granting consumers special rights and protections. Any action arising out of
this Agreement shall be litigated exclusively in any federal court, if it has jurisdiction over the matter, or any state court, if there is no federal jurisdiction, located within the state where any Service Location that is a subject of such action is located, in the plaintiff Party's sole discretion, and the Parties expressly consent and irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of said courts for purpose of any such actions and covenant not to sue in any other court. The Parties agree not to raise, and waive, any objections or defenses based upon venue or forum non conveniens. EACH OF THE PARTIES HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING, OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE) DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.
The Parties agree that any action, suit or proceeding arising out of or in connection with this Agreement shall be brought in the plaintiff or claimant Party's individual capacity and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding. EACH OF THE PARTIES HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO ASSERT ANY CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER PARTY AS A REPRESENTATIVE OR MEMBER IN ANY CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. TO THE EXTENT EITHER PARTY IS SO PERMITTED TO PROCEED, THE PARTIES AGREE THAT: (A) THE PREVAILING PARTY SHALL NOT BE ENTITLED TO RECOVER ATTORNEYS' FEES OR COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH ACTION; AND (B) THE PARTY WHO INITIATES OR PARTICIPATES AS A CLASS MEMBER WILL NOT SUBMIT A CLAIM OR OTHERWISE PARTICIPATE IN ANY RECOVERY SECURED THROUGH SUCH ACTION.

## XVI. SEVERABILITY AND WAIVER

If any provision in this Agreement is determined or rendered void, unlawful, or otherwise unenforceable for any reason whatsoever, (A) the remaining provisions shall remain in force and shall not otherwise be affected, and (B) such provision or section shall be deemed amended to the extent necessary to make it valid while still giving effect to the agreement of the Parties. The rights and remedies of the Parties under this Agreement and at law are cumulative. No waiver of any breach of this Agreement shall operate as a waiver of any other or subsequent breach. No delay, failure, or single or partial exercise by AEP Energy in enforcing any part of this Agreement shall be deemed a waiver of or shall prejudice any of its rights or remedies hereunder.

## XVII. ENTIRE AGREEMENT, ABENDMENT, AND MISCELLANEOUS

This Agreement sets forth all understandings between the Parties regarding the subject matter hereof, and any prior contracts, understandings, and representations, whether oral or written, relating to such subject matter are merged into, and superseded by, this Agreement. No waiver, alteration, amendment, or modification of any of the provisions of this Agreement shall be binding unless in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of each Party. No failure to enforce shall be deemed to constitute an amendment hereto. This Agreement constitutes a master agreement under which one or more Attachment(s) may be executed for the purpose of designating Retail Energy supply, respectively, with respect to the Service Location(s) listed on the relevant Attachment, and all transactions are entered into in reliance on the fact that these General Terms and Conditions and any and all Attachments form a single agreement between the Parties, and the Parties would not otherwise enter into any transactions.

# Exhibit A to Master Energy Purchase Agreement - Electric Commodity Sales 

The following details of this Exhibit A (this "Exhibit A") to the Master Energy Purchase Agreement - Electric Commodity Sales (the "Master Agreement") shall, upon execution, become part of and be governed by the terms of the Master Agreement (the Master Agreement, together with this Exhibit A and any Attachment(s) hereto, to be hereinafter referred to collectively as the "Agreement") and be dated and effective as of 11/20/2020. Capitalized terms not otherwise defined in this Exhibit A shall have the meaning ascribed to such terms in the Master Agreement.

Nature of Purchase and Sale Obligation: AEP Energy shall sell to Customer, and Customer shall purchase from AEP Energy, Customer's full usage requirements of Retail Energy at Customer's facilities based upon the retail electric energy requirements of the Service Location(s) listed on the relevant Attachment A-1.

Retail Energy Pricing: Customer's total monthly invoice may be itemized by the various costs associated with the functions specific to Retail Energy supply and delivery in the EDC service territory listed in the relevant Attachment A-1. The itemized costs shall be determined by the executed Attachment(s) hereto and as described in the Definitions of Terms below. The below Energy Price or Default Energy Price, as applicable, does not include any EDC or otherwise non-bypassable charges for services under the applicable electric rate tariff or any applicable (and not expressly included) taxes.

Term: AEP Energy shall use reasonable efforts to begin supplying Retail Energy to Customer (the "Commencement Date") under the relevant Attachment A-1 (a) upon the meter read date that is estimated to be on or around the Anticipated Start Date specified in the relevant Attachment A-1, and (b) after AEP Energy receives confirmation that the EDC has completed its processing and has accepted the delivery service request; provided, however, that in no event shall the Commencement Date be fewer than three (3) calendar days following the Offer Expiration Time set forth in the relevant Attachment. AEP Energy shall not be liable for any lost savings or lost opportunity as a result of a delay in the Commencement Date. This Exhibit A shall remain in effect from the date hereof and the relevant Term shall continue concurrently with any Attachment A-1 then in effect, unless sooner terminated under the Agreement.

## Definitions of Terms:

The following terms are applicable to all products; however, charges shall only be itemized if prescribed in the relevant Attachment A-1 and shall be calculated as prescribed in such Attachment A-1:

Energy Losses: Energy losses are costs associated with the delivery of the Retail Energy as prescribed in the applicable transmission and distribution tariffs and are incurred based on the difference between EDC metered volumes and settlement volumes provided by the Regional Transmission Organization (RTO).
Capacity: The capacity peak load contribution (PLC) is determined and provided by the EDC for each of Customer's EDC account number(s). Capacity obligations are administered by the applicable RTO and determined for Customer using its PLC and applicable rates.
Transmission: Unless the EDC is responsible for transmission service, AEP Energy shall act as Customer's agent for securing and managing Customer's transmission service during the term of the Agreement. The network service peak load (NSPL) contribution is determined and provided by the EDC for each of Customer's EDC account number(s). The Network Integration Transmission Service (NITS) or transmission obligations are administered by the applicable RTO and determined for Customer using its NSPL and applicable rates.
Ancillary Services: Ancillary services costs include all other applicable RTO and Open Access Transmission Tariff (OATT) charges not otherwise included in this Exhibit A.
RPS: Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS) are a regulation that requires the increased production of energy from renewable energy sources. RPS requirements shall be based upon renewable compliance charges, including costs associated with meeting renewable portfolio standards and all other environmental and renewal program compliance standards at the levels required under applicable law by the EDC or by state or federal regulatory agencies. To the extent the below Energy Price or Default Energy Price, as applicable, does not include all applicable RPS requirements, the RPS will be based on AEP Energy's incurred costs and billed as a separate line item.
The following terms are applicable to certain products (as indicated in the relevant Attachment A-1); however, charges shall only be itemized if prescribed in the relevant Attachment A-1 and shall be calculated as prescribed in such Attachment A-1:

Energy Price: The Energy Price shall be determined by AEP Energy using Customer's actual and estimated historical and forecasted load data, which is considered representative of the Service Location(s)' anticipated Retail Energy requirements for the term. The Energy Price is set forth in the Attachment A-1 and applies to all Retail Energy covered under the relevant Attachment A-1, including any unmetered lighting volumes.

Excess Usage Charge: Usage above the FRCQ shall be billed at the Default Energy Price.
