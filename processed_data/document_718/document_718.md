Notwithstanding the foregoing, NextEra Energy Services shall be under no obligation to supply any Accounts under a residential rate class and, if NextEra Energy Services does supply such Accounts, Customer hereby represents and warrants to NextEra Energy Services that such Accounts are used for commercial or governmental purposes. By entering into this Agreement, Customer acknowledges and agrees that it waives any rights it may have under Illinois law to acquire any portion of its electricity requirement for the Account(s) from the LDU or from a supplier other than NextEra Energy Services during the Initial Term and any Holdover Period.
3. CUSTOMER INFORMATION. Customer hereby authorizes NextEra Energy Services to obtain or access from the LDU and/or Customer current and historical electricity cost and usage data of Customer, Customer's payment and credit history, and other information generally relevant to the supply and associated services to be supplied under this Agreement. Customer agrees to provide additional documentation regarding such authorization as requested by NextEra Energy Services. Customer agrees, upon request, to provide NextEra Energy Services with facility descriptions, operating information, meter identification numbers and locations, and such other information available to Customer as NextEra Energy Services may reasonably require to provide electric service pursuant to this Agreement. Customer's expected energy usage for the Accounts may change for various reasons including, without limitation, additional equipment going on-line, ramp-up in equipment use, equipment modifications, increasing operating hours, remodel of facilities, new construction, applications for new construction permits, participation in demand response programs, participation in special government electricity supply programs or on-site electric generation of any type or size. Customer shall provide NextEra Energy Services at least thirty (30) days' advance notice whenever it believes that it will experience a "MAC Event", as defined below, and shall provide good faith estimates of the associated usage change. As used in this Agreement, a "MAC Event" shall be deemed to have occurred when Customer's monthly aggregate usage, for two (2) or more consecutive months, is either less than eighty percent ( $80 \%$ ) or greater than one hundred twenty percent ( $120 \%$ ) of the usage reasonably expected by NextEra Energy Services for such months. Irrespective of whether Customer has provided notice to NextEra Energy Services, Customer shall pay NextEra Energy Services the full amount of any losses, and/or new or increased costs and charges, reasonably associated with each MAC Event. Such losses, and/or costs and charges, may be charged to Customer as Pass-Through Charges.
4. ENROLLMENT. NextEra Energy Services shall use commercially reasonable efforts to promptly enroll Customer's Account(s) with the LDU in accordance with the intended Service Commencement Date, and Customer

agrees to take steps to cooperate with NextEra Energy Services' efforts to perform such enrollment. NextEra Energy Services shall not be held liable to Customer for delay or failure in enrolling Customer's Account(s) if such delay or failure was due to any cause beyond NextEra Energy Services' control. Further, notwithstanding any provision in the Agreement to the contrary, it is possible that, for various reasons such as the Account is not existing, the Account is not active or the Account is not the "first in", some or all the Accounts cannot be enrolled. All such un-enrolled Account(s) shall be subject to payment of the Early Termination Fee (or damages if greater) by Customer. NextEra Energy Services shall not be required to serve such un-enrolled Account(s). If any such un-enrolled Account(s) are subsequently enrolled during the Initial Term, such subsequently enrolled Account(s) shall be automatically added to service under this Agreement without an amendment hereto (i.e., an amendment signed by both Parties).
5. TERM OF AGREEMENT. This Agreement shall become effective on the Effective Date, with service commencing for each respective Account(s) on the Service Commencement Date, and shall continue for the Initial Term. After the Initial Term expires, this Agreement shall continue on a month-to-month basis at the Holdover Price unless and until either Party terminates this Agreement upon at least thirty (30) days written notice, in which event such termination shall be effective after the noticed termination date on the date on which the LDU successfully switches Customer's Account(s) to another competitive electricity supplier or to the LDU's generation service.
6. PRICING. The Price for electric supply provided to Customer by NextEra Energy Services during the Initial Term is set forth in the BEA and subject to any adjustments set forth in this Agreement. Such Price includes the charge for electricity and estimated charges for any electricity components set forth in the BEA as included in the Price. Depending on the bill format, certain Pass-Through Charges, such as those described in the BEA and this TOS (including those arising from one or more Change in Law events), may appear on the bill as a separate line item or an increase to the Price shown on the bill, at the option of NextEra Energy Services.

The unit price for electricity during the Holdover Period shall be the Holdover Price, not the Price. The Holdover Price is a variable price and determined by NextEra Energy Services in its sole discretion. The Holdover Price can be based on a variety of factors, and is not solely driven by current and future market prices or risks. The Holdover Price can change without prior notice to Customer unless required by law. In some cases, the Holdover Price may vary significantly from the Price charged during the Initial Term of this Agreement. The following are some, but not all, of the material factors that can influence NextEra Energy Services' determination of the initial Holdover Price and any subsequent changes to the Holdover Price: (i) the current and future expected prices for wholesale electric supply (including an analysis of the supply and demand factors affecting these prices, if desired) and NextEra Energy Services' desired risk premiums on any pricing; (ii) NextEra Energy Services' supply position in the market and its comfort level with respect to those positions; (iii) NextEra Energy Services' expected gross margin, target gross and profit margins, and desired revenues; (iv) NextEra Energy Services' customer counts and attrition; and/or (v) the prices charged by competitors, and the LDU.
7. BILLING AND FEES. Each month, Customer shall pay the NextEra Energy Services Electricity Charge (as defined herein). Unless the Parties agree in writing to alternate payment arrangements, Customer consents to be billed monthly for services provided hereunder through one of the following billing options, as permitted by law, at NextEra Energy Services' discretion: (i) Customer will receive one invoice from the LDU that includes the NextEra Energy Services Electricity Charge, the Delivery Charges and applicable Taxes and Add-On Charges (the "Consolidated Billing Option"); or (ii) Customer will receive two invoices, one from NextEra Energy Services for the NextEra Energy Services Electricity Charge and one from the LDU for the Delivery Charges, each with applicable Taxes and Add-On Charges (the "Dual Billing Option"). Under the Consolidated Billing Option, Customer will make payments directly to the LDU pursuant to the applicable LDU tariff. Under the Dual Billing Option, payments are due to NextEra Energy Services within SIXTEEN (16) days from the date of the invoice. If, under the Consolidated Billing Option or Dual Billing Option, any payment for the NextEra Energy Services Electricity Charge made by Customer to NextEra Energy Services or to the LDU is late under the applicable payment terms, Customer may be assessed the Late Fee and its delinquent balances may be reported to a credit agency. Further, in addition to any other rights of NextEra Energy Services hereunder, if, during the Dual Billing Option, any payment for the NextEra Energy Services Electricity Charge is late under the applicable payment terms, then NextEra Energy Services shall have the right, without prior notice to the customer, to convert all billing hereunder to the Consolidated Billing Option and convert the Price as necessary, on a commercial reasonable basis, to a unit price sufficient to enable such Consolidated Billing. NextEra Energy Services has the right to apply any credit balance on a particular Account to a balance owed on any other Customer Account. NextEra Energy Services may assess a twenty five dollar (\$25) fee against any transaction not processed due to insufficient funds or credit availability for any method of payment, including checks, bank drafts or credit card.

If the LDU fails to timely obtain or transmit a meter reading, NextEra Energy Services will issue or cause to be issued a bill to Customer based on its estimated Energy Usage and charges during the Billing Period. NextEra Energy Services will include or cause to be included in any subsequent bill from NextEra Energy Services, adjustments related to previous billings, including estimates, previous billing errors, meter read errors, or other errors or omissions. In the event that Customer disputes a bill for the NextEra Energy Services Electricity Charge, Customer must pay any undisputed portion of the bill by the due date specified in the applicable payment terms. If the unpaid, disputed portion of the bill is subsequently resolved in favor of NextEra Energy Services, the Late Fee will be applied to such unpaid amounts. NextEra Energy Services has the right to set off any amounts owed by NextEra Energy Services to Customer under this Agreement against any amounts owed by Customer to NextEra Energy Services. In the event of deferred billing of any Pass-Through Charge to NextEra Energy Services, estimated Pass-Through Charges may be billed to Customer in the interim and Customer shall pay such estimated Pass-Through Charges.

The Parties understand and agree that the RPS Charge is based on a REC and obligation costing allocation mechanism based on periodic estimates that will likely not reflect the final actual cost of such RECs and obligations, and the Parties agree to accept such risk. NextEra Energy Services will determine the monthly RPS Charge in its sole discretion based on its then-current estimate of the cost of such RECs and obligations, and the published energy portfolio obligations, but such charges will be ongoing, and it shall not be required to provide a credit if the actual cost to purchase RECs and obligations for a month is less than the RPS Charge for such month. NextEra Energy Services will determine, in its sole discretion, its strategy for purchasing RECS and obligations, including without limitation, the timing, frequency, volume, and actual price it pays for such RECs and obligations.
8. DISPUTES OR COMPLAINTS. Customer should contact NextEra Energy Services at 866-319-4392 (toll free) with any questions or complaints regarding its generation service or bills for the NextEra Energy Services Electricity Charge. Customer should contact its LDU directly in the event of a power outage or if Customer has questions regarding the Delivery Charges on its bill.
9. CREDIT AND DEPOSIT REQUIREMENTS. NextEra Energy Services reserves the right to request a credit history on an applicant for service prior to offering service and to refuse service to anyone who does not meet NextEra Energy Services' credit standards. If NextEra Energy Services determines, prior to offering service or at any time during the term of this Agreement, that Customer's credit is unsatisfactory, NextEra Energy Services has the right to require Customer to make alternate payment or credit arrangements to ensure prompt payment of amounts owed or otherwise payable under this Agreement including, without limitation, the posting of an initial or subsequent security deposit, or an increase in the amount of the deposit. In addition, if Customer's Energy Usage increases during the term of this Agreement, NextEra Energy Services may require a security deposit or an increase in the amount of an existing security deposit. The posting or amount of any security deposit hereunder shall be subject to any limitations imposed by applicable law. A security deposit in the form of cash that is held for more than six months from the date of deposit shall earn simple interest thereon at the rate payable on two-year, United States Treasury notes. A security deposit shall be refunded by means of a credit to Customer's bill once Customer has made twenty-four (24) consecutive payments without assessment of any Late Fees. Upon termination of service, NextEra Energy Services will apply any security deposit plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon toward any outstanding balance on Customer's final bill and will refund any remaining security deposit.
10. TERMINATION OF AGREEMENT BY CUSTOMER. If Customer terminates this Agreement, in whole or as relating to any single Account(s), before the end of the Initial Term, Customer shall pay NextEra Energy Services the Early Termination Fee. In addition, if Customer terminates this Agreement with less than thirty (30) days advance written notice, Customer shall be assessed the Insufficient Notice Fee. In the event that Customer terminates this Agreement as provided for in this Section, Customer shall be obligated to pay for the electricity and related services provided to Customer pursuant to this Agreement prior to the date that such termination becomes effective, including Late Fees, if applicable. Should NextEra Energy Services incur damages greater than the Early Termination Fee as a result of such termination of this Agreement by Customer before the end of the Initial Term, Customer shall pay to NextEra Energy Services such damages. Such damages will be calculated based upon the net present value of the product of (i) the difference between the Price and the market prices that are commercially available to NextEra Energy Services for the same quantities of energy which would have been supplied hereunder for the remainder of the Initial Term, and (ii) the estimated Energy Usage by Customer, as determined by NextEra Energy Services, during the remainder of the Initial Term. To determine "market prices", as used above, NextEra Energy Services may consider, among other things, settlement prices of applicable NYMEX futures contracts, quotations from leading dealers in energy swap contracts and other bona fide offers from parties participating in the wholesale and/or retail power markets, which may include NextEra Energy Services and/or its affiliates, all as commercially available to NextEra Energy Services and all as adjusted for the length of the remaining Initial Term and differences in transmission costs and volume. NextEra Energy Services will not be required to enter into any replacement

transaction in order to determine such market prices or actual damages. The Parties agree that the amounts recoverable hereunder are a reasonable estimate of loss and not a penalty.
11. TERMINATION OF AGREEMENT BY NEXTERA ENERGY SERVICES. NextEra Energy Services has the right to terminate this Agreement if Customer: (i) fails to make timely payment of all amounts due NextEra Energy Services; or (ii) fails to post a security deposit under the provisions of the Credit and Deposit Requirements Section herein within ten (10) days of a request for deposit; or (iii) breaches any warranty or representation to NextEra Energy Services; or (iv) defaults on any material obligation under this Agreement; or (v)(A) makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors, (B) files a petition or otherwise authorizes the commencement of a proceeding under the Bankruptcy Code or similar law for protection of creditors, or has such petition filed against it, (C) otherwise becomes bankrupt or insolvent, or (D) is unable to pay its debts as they fall due; or (vi) enters into a merger with, or sells substantially all of its assets to, another entity that fails to assume Customer's obligations under this Agreement. Termination of electric service for space heating purposes during the months of November through March are subject to timing and notice requirements provided in Sections 8-202, 8-203 and 8-205 of the IPUA. In the event service is terminated in accordance with this Section, Customer shall pay the Early Termination Fee or, if applicable, damages incurred by NextEra Energy Services as provided in this Agreement. If NextEra Energy Services terminates this Agreement, Customer's electricity will be provided by the LDU under the LDU's applicable generation service tariff unless another competitive electricity supplier has been chosen by Customer.
12. TITLE, RISK OF LOSS AND INDEMNIFICATION. Title and risk of loss to the electricity sold hereunder shall pass from NextEra Energy Services to Customer when it is delivered to the Delivery Point for each Account(s).

13. FORCE MAJEURE. In the event that either Party's performance of its obligations under this Agreement, other than payment obligations, is interrupted or delayed by any occurrence not caused by either Party, whether such occurrence is an act of God or public enemy, or whether such occurrence is caused by storm, earthquake, or other natural forces, or by war, riot, public disturbance, labor action, or the acts or omissions of anyone not a Party to this Agreement, then the Party affected by such occurrence shall be excused from such performance and any further performance required under this Agreement for whatever period is reasonably necessary to remedy the effects of that occurrence.

In calculating the cost or charge, if the increase is not reasonably evident from the Change in Law itself, or if the costs or charges subsequently increase based on another event, including a subsequent auction, NextEra Energy Services may calculate the increase based on the cost or charge incurred after the Change in Law event as compared to NextEra Energy Services' earlier estimates of the relevant cost(s) or charge(s).
