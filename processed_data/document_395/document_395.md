# ILLINOIS COMMERCIAL CUSTOMER TERMS \& CONDITIONS 

You authorize Public Power, LLC ("Company"), a member of the Crius Energy family of brands, to change your electricity and/or natural gas supplier, as the case may be, to Company and to supply your business with all the Services you need, subject to the eligibility requirements of your local electric or natural gas utility ("Utility"). Your Enrollment Documentation, which includes your Enrollment Form, these Terms and Conditions, and any attachments create your agreement with the Company ("Agreement") and supersedes any oral or written statements made in connection with this Agreement or the supply of your Services. Capitalized terms used herein have the meaning ascribed to them as listed within the Agreement as well as in the "Definitions" section herein.

1. SERVICES. Upon successful completion and receipt of all customer enrollment requirements, Company will supply Services for your business. Company is a retail marketer of Services and is not your Utility. Your Utility will continue to deliver Services to your business, read your meter, send your bill and make repairs and charge you for its services related to delivering your commodities. Your Utility will also respond to emergencies and provide other traditional utility services. You understand that you are not required to switch your Services to Company. The Company does not charge you for starting or stopping Service; however, your Utility may charge switching fees, so please check with your Utility.
2. TERM. Company will begin supplying your Services when the Utility switches your account to Company. Your Agreement will continue for the Term specified in the Enrollment Documentation or herein, and if applicable for the Renewal Term. Your Term is based on monthly billing cycles as determined by your Utility and each monthly billing cycle may not represent a full calendar month. If your Utility bills bimonthly, Company will treat this as two monthly billing cycles. Typically it takes one to two billing cycles for your Service to be switched from your Utility to the Company, but there may be a delay before the Utility switches Services and you understand that Company is not responsible for any such delays. Your natural gas enrollment with Company is subject to certain Company minimum Utility pooling requirements; if such requirements are not met in a reasonable time period, your Agreement will not be accepted and you will remain with your current service provider.
3. PRICE. Company does not charge any fee for you to switch from your utility to Company. Please note that some products have specific fees related to the product or plan you choose which are detailed in your product Enrollment Documentation; these fees are not switching fees. Each month you will pay for the Services you consume. For electricity, your bill will be calculated by multiplying your Rate by the amount of electricity you consumed in kilowatt-hours during the billing cycle, plus any applicable Fees. For electricity, the price on your Enrollment Form includes energy, shaping and balancing, losses, ancillaries, capacity, transmission (NITs), renewable portfolio standards, credit, and ARR. For natural gas, your bill will be calculated by multiplying your Rate by the amount of natural gas you consumed in McIs, ccIs or therms, as applicable, during the billing cycle, plus any applicable Fees. For natural gas, the
price on your Enrollment Form includes energy, fuel, ufg, basis and reserve. Depending on your Utility's billing practices, your Rate during the billing cycle may be applied pro rata, resulting in a blended rate of the previous month and the current month Rate. If your price is based on an estimated usage for such Services, the Company has the right to bill you on actual usage when such information is made available and you have the obligation to pay Company for such actual usage amounts.

## 4. RATE PLAN OPTIONS.

a. Fixed Rate. If you selected a fixed rate, the Rate for your Service is the Rate indicated in your Enrollment Documentation and guaranteed not to change for the Term, except as otherwise provided for herein ("Fixed Rate").
b. Variable Rate. If you selected a variable rate, the Rate for your Service is the Rate indicated in your Enrollment Documentation and will vary based on numerous factors, including but not limited to market conditions, operations costs, capacity costs, transmission (NITs), load ratio, ancillary costs, hedging costs, costs associate with procuring renewable energy credits and other factors and may include an introductory rate for such time as indicated in your Enrollment Documentation ("Variable Rate"). Your Variable Rate may change on each monthly bill cycle.
c. Index Rates. If you selected an index rate, the Rate for your Service will be the index Rate indicated in your Enrollment Documentation and will vary in accordance with the terms of the specific index ("Index Rate").
d. Understanding and Selecting Rates. You understand that unless you have been offered a Rate in writing confirmed by the Company that expressly provides otherwise, there are no guaranteed savings and your Rate may be higher or lower than the Utility's rate in any given month.

## 5. TERMINATION

a. Your Right to Terminate. If you terminate a Fixed Rate plan prior to the end of your Term, you will be charged an Early Termination Fee equal to the Remaining Contract Quantity times the greater of (i) Contract Price less Market Price at the time of the termination, or (ii) $\$ 0.02$ per kWh or $\$ 0.20$ per Ccf/therm. Remaining Contract Quantity shall mean the total estimated usage for the period remaining in the Fixed Term of this Agreement at the time of termination, based on Buyer's historical usage or Company's estimated

usage calculated in a commercially reasonable manner. The Market Price for the remainder of the Fixed Term will be determined by Company in a commercially reasonable manner.
b. Company's Right to Terminate. You are affirming to Company that you are a Commercial Customer, with certain usage requirements, and that you have provided Company with your correct and complete name, address, and contact information and that you do not have any outstanding balance with Company. If there is any evidence that these statements are or become untrue, or you otherwise provide fraudulent or misrepresented information, Company can cancel this Agreement immediately. If, due to new or changes in tariffs, rates, riders, fees, or customer load profiles, charged or authorized by the Utility, MISO, PJM, Illinois Commerce Commission ("ICC"), FERC or other regulatory party with respect to the acquisition, sale, delivery, and purchase of the Services, performance of this Agreement becomes materially uneconomical to Company, Company can cancel this Agreement after following the ICC regulations regarding notice provisions and the prescribed time frame(s) if any apply. If Company cancels this Agreement, you must still pay all Company charges through the date you are switched to another supplier or returned to the Utility for service. Your cancellation will not be effective until Company gives notice to the Utility of your cancellation request and the Utility accepts and processes the transaction.
c. Termination for Failure to Pay. Failure to pay your bill may result in the disconnection of Services in accordance with the Utility's policies and rules, and this Agreement may be automatically terminated. Company may terminate this Agreement on written notice to you should you fail to pay your bill or fail to meet any agreed-upon payment arrangements with the Company.
c. Termination Notice: Effect of Termination. To terminate this Agreement, you may notify Company as detailed in Section 13. Please provide your name, address, phone number, account number and a statement that you are terminating the Agreement. Termination will be processed immediately but is effective upon your Utility processing your termination and you are obligated to pay for the Services provided pursuant to this Agreement until you are returned to your Utility or alternative supplier.
6. BILLING AND PAYMENT. The Services you purchase from Company will be included in your Utility monthly bill or in a separate invoice from Company. If from the Utility, the Utility will set your payment due date and the payment address. Any bill not paid in full by its due date will incur a late payment fee in accordance with the Utility's or the Company's billing and payment policies and procedures, as the case may be. You may be liable for the costs the Company incurs if Company must terminate your Services for failure to pay, such as collection costs or attorney fees. Company shall have the right to setoff and net against any undisputed amounts owed by you under this Agreement, and the Company shall additionally have the right to setoff and net against any deposit or security provided by you pursuant
to this Agreement any amounts, charges or damages owed by you to Company. You will be billed and pay Company for the Services based on meter readings and consumption information that Company receives from your Utility ("Billing Quantity"). Company will have the option to adjust the Billing Quantity for fuel and line loss retained by your Utility and interstate transporters from the Purchased Quantities. You are responsible for paying and reimbursing Company for all applicable Fees. If you are tax exempt, you must furnish Company an exemption certificate before your Services commence.
7. CUSTOMER INFORMATION. All authorizations provided herein will remain in effect for the Term and, if applicable, the Renewal Term of this Agreement; however, authorization may be rescinded by you any time by contacting Company.
a. Credit Requirement. You understand that Company may review your credit history. If you fail to meet Company credit criteria, you understand that Company may refuse or terminate Service. You may be required to promptly provide Credit Enhancements to continue Service if (i) there is a deterioration in your credit rating, (ii) you fail to make timely payments for Services hereunder, or (iii) there is a Change in Usage. You have the right to request from Company up to twenty-four months of your payment history without charge.
b. Customer Information. You consent and authorize Company to obtain your Customer Information from your Utility and, under a confidentiality agreement, share your Customer Information with Company Agents. Company will not otherwise release Customer Information without Customer consent, except as required by law.
8. RENEWAL. If you do not terminate Services or execute a new agreement, your Services will automatically default to a Variable Rate. If after your Term ends you: (i) do not execute a new agreement; (ii) switch to another supplier; or (iii) return to your Utility, you are not subject to any Early Termination Fees.
9. DISPUTE RESOLUTION. If you have billing questions or would like to make an inquiry about the Company's terms of service, you may contact the Company as indicated in Section 13. We will attempt to resolve the matter within five (5) business days. If your complaint is not resolved after you have called the Company and/or the Utility, or for general utility information, you may contact the ICC for assistance.
You and the Company both agree to resolve Disputes only by arbitration or in small claims court (for qualifying claims). You and the Company each agree that arbitration will only be pursued on an individual basis, and will not be pursued on a classwide, representative or consolidated basis. This Agreement does not allow class, representative or collective arbitrations even if the American Arbitration Association (the "AAA") procedures or rules would.
Except as otherwise provided below, the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq. (the "FAA") applies exclusively to this agreement to arbitrate, and this agreement to arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted. The arbitrator's decision

and award is final and binding, with some exceptions under the FAA, and judgment on the award may be entered in any court with jurisdiction.

Prior to initiating arbitration, a party must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written notice of dispute ("Dispute Notice"). The Dispute Notice to the Company should be addressed to the Notice Address listed in Section 13. The Dispute Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or Dispute; and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought ("Demand"). If the Company and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within thirty (30) days after the Dispute Notice is received, you or the Company may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by the Company or you shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator.
The arbitration will be conducted by: (i) a neutral third party arbitrator mutually agreed upon by you and the Company; or (ii) the AAA. The arbitration will be governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, "AAA Rules") of the AAA, as modified by this Agreement.

g. Non-Waiver. The failure by one party to require performance of any provision shall not affect that party's right to require performance at any time thereafter, nor shall a waiver of any breach or default of this Agreement constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach or default or a waiver of the provision itself.
