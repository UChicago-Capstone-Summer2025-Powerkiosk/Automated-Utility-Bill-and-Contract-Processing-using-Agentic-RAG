## ——DID YOU FORGET US?——

Our records show that your account is still past due. To avoid further collection action, you must pay this bill immediately. If you have just made payment please accept our thanks. You can confirm your current account balance or make a payment at the Customer Assistance number above using our automated telephone system or at www.nationalgridus.com.

If you are experiencing a financial problem, you may be eligible for a deferred payment agreement which considers your financial circumstances and brings your past due bills up to date with monthly payments. This is available using our telephone and online services, if eligible.
National Grid filed a comprehensive proposal with the Mass. Department of Public Utilities to set new rates. If approved, new rates will be effective October 1, 2018, which may lead to a delay of some bills as we work to implement rate changes. Please be advised that your October and November bills and payment dates may be in close proximity to one another. Please visit ngrid.com/magasratefaq for more information.
