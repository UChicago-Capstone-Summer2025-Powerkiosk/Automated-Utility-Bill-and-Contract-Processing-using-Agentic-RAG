Dear Taxpayer,
A review of our records indicates that the Massachusetts sales/use tax exemption for PINE MANOR COLLEGE, a tax-exempt 501(c) (3) organization, will expire on 01/04/09.

The Department of Revenue is issuing this notice in lieu of a new Form St-2, "Certificate of Exemption". The notice verifies that the Massachusetts Department of Revenue has renewed the sales/use tax exemption for PINE MANOR COLLEGE subject to the conditions stated in Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 64H, sections 6(d) or (e), as applicable.

The organization remains responsible for maintaining its exempt status and for reporting any loss or change of its status to the Department of Revenue. Absent the Department of Revenue's receipt of information from the taxpayer by the expiration date of the current certificate that the entity no longer holds exempt status under the above provisions, the taxpayer's certificate is renewed. This renewal will expire on 01/04/19.

The taxpayer's existing Form ST-2, in combination with this renewal notice may be presented as evidence of the entity's continuing exempt status. Provided that this requirement is met, all purchases of tangible personal property by the taxpayer are exempt from sales/use taxation under Chapter 64 H or I respectively, to the extent that such property is used in the conduct of the purchaser's business.

Any abuse or misuse of this notice by any tax-exempt organization or any unauthorized use by any individual constitutes a serious violation and will lead to revocation. Willful misuse of this notice is subject to criminal sanctions of up to one year in prison and $\$ 10,000$ in fines ( $\$ 50,000$ for corporations).

This notice may be reproduced.
Sincerely,

Navjeet K. Bal
Commissioner of Revenue
