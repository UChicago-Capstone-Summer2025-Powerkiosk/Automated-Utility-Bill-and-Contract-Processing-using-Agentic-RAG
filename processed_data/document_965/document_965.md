1.3 We will follow industry processes and transfer or install the meters for your Sites to us from your previous supplier within 21 days of this Agreement unless:
1.3.1 The Start Date in the Particulars is more than 21 days after the date of this Agreement in which case we will transfer or install the meters at the sites on the Start Date; or
1.3.2 You ask us not to transfer the Sites or install the meters; or
1.3.3 Your previous supplier blocks the transfer to us; or
1.3.4 We do not have the correct information to complete the transfer or install the meters (having taken all reasonable steps to obtain the information from you or elsewhere); or
1.3.5 Works need to be carried out due to the supply being through an exempt distribution system; or

1.5.1 There is a Green Deal attached to any Site that is subject to this Agreement
1.5.2 There is a pre-payment meter or other meter at any Site that is subject to this Agreement that we cannot support (although we reserve the right to continue the supply and change the meter in accordance with clause 4.6).

Before the End Date we will contact you as part of our Renewal Process to discuss renewing or extending this Agreement for a further Fixed Price Period. On renewal your Contract Price may be different for subsequent Fixed Price Periods, as agreed between us and you during the Renewal Process.

2.1 Subject to clauses 2.1, 2.6, 2.9, 2.10 and clause 3.3 below, you will be supplied for the Fixed Price Period at the Contract Price shown in the Particulars until the stated End Date for that Fixed Price Period.
2.2 If you have chosen the Fully Fixed product (as stated in the Particulars) we may only vary the Contract Price during the applicable Fixed Price Period to reflect either (a) cost increases arising from changes in law, regulation or tax (excluding any changes to the rate charged to us for feedin tariff charges or renewable obligation charges); (b) where information provided to us by you to help us calculate the Contract Price turns out

# Corona ENERGY 

## Terms for the Supply of Electricity between Corona Energy and the Customer

to be incorrect - an example would be meter ownership status or what you use the Site for; (c) in accordance with clause 2.9, or (d) in accordance with clause 2.10 .

2.3 If you have chosen the Fixed product (as stated in the Particulars), in addition to those reasons set out in clause 2.1, we may vary the Contract Price to reflect changes in the charges imposed on us by any third party (including but not limited to those in the generation and distribution network), the rate charged to us for feed-in tariff charges or the rate charged to us for renewable obligations.

2.4 If you have chosen the FairView product (as stated in the Particulars) we may only vary the Contract Price during the applicable Fixed Price Period to reflect either (a) cost increases arising from changes in law, regulation or tax (excluding any changes to the rate charged to us for feedin tariff charges or renewable obligation charges); (b) where information provided to us by you to help us calculate the Contract Price turns out to be incorrect - an example would be meter ownership status or what you use the Site for; (c) in accordance with clause 2.9, or (d) to reflect changes in the charges imposed on us by the Distributor and/or Transporter.

2.5 For the avoidance of doubt, the Contract Price is applicable only to the Sites agreed to be supplied at the Start Date or at the commencement of subsequent Fixed Price Periods. Any sites which you wish to add to this Agreement during a Fixed Price Period will be the subject of a separate price quote from us.

2.6 Your Contract Price assumes that we will be providing meter operator services. If you employ your own meter operator or we are required to change a meter to enable us to supply you we reserve the right to adjust your Contract Price.

2.7 If the Actual Consumption in any half-hour period falls outside the Forecast Tolerance, then:
2.7.1 an additional amount may be charged to you in respect of Excess Electricity at the System Buy Price minus the Commodity Price.
2.7.2 an additional amount may be charged to you in respect of Deficit Electricity at the Commodity Price minus the System Sell Price.

In the event that we require a security deposit, the deposit should be sent to our bank account for deposits the details of which are Account Number: 03025071, Sort Code: 20-05-74 Ref: Customer's name.

2.9 We reserve the right to pass through any element of EMR-related charges in the event at any time where:
2.9.1 The actual charges to Corona increase by more than 5 times the lowest rate of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) in the four quarters immediately preceding the Contract Date; or
2.9.2 Forecast or published charges for any period increases from that at the Contract Date

2.10 We reserve the right to vary the non-commodity elements of the Contract Price due to charges imposed by the Distributor and/or Transporter as a result of OFGEM's Targeted Charging Review and/or where the final costs deviate from any estimates to an extent which we could not reasonably have foreseen.

## 3 Payment

3.1 We will invoice you on a monthly basis for electricity supplied by e-billing. Should you require a paper invoice, there will be an additional charge. You must pay each invoice in full within 10 days of the date of invoice (unless agreed otherwise in the Particulars). You are not obliged to pay us if you have a genuine bona fide dispute, in which case any amount not in dispute should still be paid. If you fail to pay any sum that is due on time we may charge interest at the rate of $4 \%$ above the base lending rate of Lloyds TSB Bank plc, as well as make a late payment administration charge per invoice in accordance with the levels set out in the Late Payment of Commercial Debts legislation and regulations. Where any amounts are outstanding, we may prevent you transferring to another electricity supplier by lodging an objection (irrespective of your termination rights).

All prices are exclusive of VAT, CCL, and any other similar taxes which will be added to your invoices where appropriate and at the appropriate level. You are responsible for providing any applicable exemption certificate. If you do not provide the appropriate certificate the tax will be charged at its full rate until such time as you do provide a certificate.

All payments must be made by direct debit unless stated otherwise in the Particulars. Failure to do so may result in termination of the Agreement or an increase in the Contract Price by $1 \mathrm{p} / \mathrm{kWh}$.
3.4 Our invoices are calculated using industry data. We will be responsible for any errors we make in using this data but we are not liable for any errors that may occur in the industry data provided to us. In the event that industry data has to be corrected we reserve the right to reconcile your account and reissue corrected invoices or credit notes.

4.5 The Customer shall on or before disposal of any part of the Supply Point in which any part of the Meter Installation or related equipment is laid or installed, and at any time on request by the Supplier, grant to the Supplier and/or the Distributor and their respective agents an easement (in such form as the Supplier may reasonably require) to install, operate, maintain, test and remove such equipment or any part thereof and preventing the Customer and its successors and assigns from doing anything which might unreasonably prevent or impede access thereto by the Supplier and/or the Distributor and their respective agents.
4.6 We reserve the right to remove any meter and replace it. We also reserve the right to operate the meters in a manner that enables us to provide the supply to you including, but not limited to, operating smart meters in dumb mode or fitting AMR in accordance with clause 5.

## 5 Automatic Meter Reading

5.1 You may request that we install an AMR device at your Site(s). All such requests will be subject to Site surveys and agreement between us and you before installation takes place.
5.2 Installation of AMR devices or smart Meters is subject to a Site survey. If we can install our standard AMR device without additional work then there will be no additional charge to you. If additional work is required or we need to install a different device or a smart meter we will discuss the options with you before proceeding.
5.3 We reserve the right to install either an Automated Meter Reading ("AMR") device or smart meter at your Site(s) and you agree to allow us to do this.
5.4 If you have a smart meter or AMR device at any of your Sites you consent to us obtaining consumption data for periods of less than 1 month. We will use this data to calculate your invoices and will also use it to provide you with other services such as energy services. You can ask us not to do this by notifying us in writing at any time although this may restrict the scope of services that you can obtain from us.

## 6 Safety and Emergencies

6.1 You undertake not to use electricity in any way likely to risk any person's health and safety or to risk any damage to property.
6.2 If there is a problem with your supply, you should contact your Distributor which is named in the Particulars. You will find contact details for your Distributor on your invoices or on our website.

6.5 You agree fully to indemnify us in respect of any costs or damages incurred by us as a result of your failure to comply with your obligations under clauses 4 and 6 of this Agreement.

## 7 Change of ownership and De-Energised or Disconnected Sites

7.1 You acknowledge that we have given you the benefit of a fixed price in expectation that it would be paid in full for the whole of the Fixed Price Period, that the Contract Price has been calculated on this basis and that we have incurred costs accordingly. However, if you intend to leave the Site during a Fixed Price Period, we will allow you to terminate the Agreement early on the following conditions: (a) you must give us at least one month's written notice, stating the date you intend to leave, your new address, and the name and current address of the proposed new owner or occupant; and (b) you must provide a Meter reading on the date you leave.
7.2 If during a Fixed Price Period you cease to use electricity at any Supply Point, we will still need to charge you for costs incurred by us in relation to the Supply Point for the remainder of the Fixed Price Period which for new connections will include a proportion of the cost of the supply and installation of any meters as this has been spread across the initial term of the contract. You can ask us to de-energise or disconnect the Supply Point which may reduce these costs.

## 8 Liability and Force Majeure
