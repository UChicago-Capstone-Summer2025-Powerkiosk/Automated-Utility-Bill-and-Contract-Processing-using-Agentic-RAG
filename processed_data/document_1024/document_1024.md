The 2021 data is represented by a blue line, and the 2022 data is represented by a green line. The chart shows a peak in usage around August 2021, followed by a decline towards December 2021, and then a gradual increase in 2022.

Below the chart, there is a table titled "Average temperature in degrees" with the following data:

- Current Month: 30,344 kWh
- May 2021: 25,520 kWh
- 12-Month Usage: 358,971 kWh

## Important to know

## Your next meter reading: Jun 27

Please be sure we can safely access your meter for actual readings. Don't worry if your digital meter flashes eights from time to time. That's a normal part of the energy measuring process.

## Your service(s) may be disconnected if your payment is past due

If payment for your service(s) is past due, we may begin disconnection procedures. If your service is disconnected because of a missed payment, you must pay the amount specified in the Important
Disconnect Information section on your bill, as well as, a reconnection fee, before your service will be reconnected. The reconnection fee is $\$ 10$ for electric service that may be reconnected remotely, $\$ 69$ for electric service that is not eligible to be reconnected remotely, and $\$ 17$ for gas service. In such situations where both electric and gas service are disconnected for non-payment, the reconnection fee will not exceed $\$ 27$ for both.

## Failure to pay may result in a return to our standard offer for generation

Failure to pay charges for a competitive retail service may result in cancellation of your contract with the respective retail electric supplier. You will then be returned to Duke Energy Ohio's standard offer for generation services.

## When you pay by check

We may process the payment as a regular check or convert it into a one-time electronic check payment.

Customer Charge - The fixed monthly charge covers the cost of providing service to your location as well as maintaining customer records, billing and transactions affecting your account.
