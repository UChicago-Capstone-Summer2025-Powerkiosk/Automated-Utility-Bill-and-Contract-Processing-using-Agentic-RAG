2. SERVICES. During the Initial Term and any Holdover Period, NextEra Energy Services shall provide Customer's full electricity requirements for the Account(s) specified in this Agreement, and Customer shall obtain its full electricity requirements for such Account(s) exclusively from NextEra Energy Services on the terms and conditions specified in this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, NextEra Energy Services shall be under no obligation to supply any Accounts under a residential rate class and, if NextEra Energy Services does supply such Accounts, Customer hereby represents and warrants to NextEra Energy Services that such Accounts are used for commercial or governmental purposes. By entering into this Agreement, Customer acknowledges and agrees that it waives any rights it may have under Illinois law to acquire any portion of its electricity requirement for the Account(s) from the LDU or from a supplier other than NextEra Energy Services during the Initial Term and any Holdover Period.
3. ENERGY CONSUMPTION INFORMATION. At NextEra Energy Services' request, Customer will provide an authorization which grants NextEra Energy Services the authority to obtain Customer's current and historical electricity billing and usage data from the LDU, Customer's payment and credit history and other information specified in the authorization. Customer hereby agrees, upon request, to provide NextEra Energy Services with facility descriptions, operating information, meter identification numbers and locations, and such other information available to Customer as NextEra Energy Services may reasonably require to provide electric service pursuant to this Agreement. Customer's expected energy usage for the Accounts may change for various reasons including, without limitation, additional equipment going on-line, ramp-up in equipment use, equipment modifications, increasing operating hours, remodel of facilities, new construction, applications for new construction permits, participation in demand response programs, participation in special government electricity supply programs or on-site electric generation of any type or size. Customer shall provide NextEra Energy Services at least thirty (30) days' advance notice whenever it believes that Customer's estimated monthly aggregate usage will materially change from Customer's historical monthly usage, weather normalized (each such material change being a "MAC Event"), and shall provide good faith estimates of such usage changes. For each MAC Event, regardless of whether notice is provided, Customer shall pay NextEra Energy Services any losses, and/or new or increased costs and charges, reasonably associated with such MAC Event. Such losses, and/or costs and charges, may be charged to Customer as Pass-Through Charges.
4. ENROLLMENT. NextEra Energy Services shall use commercially reasonable efforts to promptly enroll Customer's Account(s) with the LDU in accordance with the intended Service Commencement Date, and Customer agrees to take steps to cooperate with NextEra Energy Services' efforts to perform such enrollment. NextEra Energy Services shall not be held liable to Customer for delay or failure in enrolling Customer's Account(s) if such delay or failure was due to any cause beyond NextEra Energy Services' control. Further, notwithstanding any provision in the Agreement to the contrary, it is possible that, for various reasons such as the Account is not existing, the Account is not active or the Account is not the "first in", some or all the Accounts cannot be enrolled. All such un-enrolled Account(s) shall be subject to payment of the Early Termination Fee (or damages if greater) by Customer. NextEra Energy Services shall not be required to serve such un-enrolled Account(s). If any such un-enrolled Account(s) are subsequently enrolled during the Initial Term, such subsequently enrolled Account(s) shall be automatically added to service under this Agreement without an amendment hereto (i.e., an amendment signed by both Parties).
5. TERM OF AGREEMENT. This Agreement shall become effective on the Effective Date, with service commencing for each respective Account(s) on the Service Commencement Date, and shall continue for the Initial Term. After the Initial Term expires, this Agreement shall continue on a month-to-month basis at the Holdover Price unless and until either Party terminates this Agreement upon at least thirty (30) days written notice, in which event such termination shall be effective after the noticed termination date on the date on which the LDU successfully switches Customer's Account(s) to another competitive electricity supplier or to the LDU's generation service.
6. PRICING. The Price for electric supply provided to Customer by NextEra Energy Services during the Initial Term is set forth in the BEA and subject to any adjustments set forth in this Agreement. Such Price includes the charge for electricity and estimated charges for the electricity components set forth in the BEA. Such charges for such electricity components have been estimated by NextEra Energy Services using information and data provided by

Customer, the LDU and/or PJM. To the extent, if any, that any of such charges are higher based on information received from the LDU or PJM, or if such charges increase during the term of this Agreement, NextEra Energy Services may charge Customer an allocation for such increased charges ("Price Component Adjustments"), as part of the NextEra Energy Services Electricity Charge. Depending on the bill format, Price Component Adjustments may appear on Customer's bill as a line item or Price adjustment.

The price for electricity during the Holdover Period shall be the Holdover Price, not the Price. The Holdover Price, which includes the same energy components as the Price, may change without prior written notice to Customer at the sole discretion of NextEra Energy Services until either Party terminates the Agreement pursuant to the "Term of Agreement" Section of this TOS. The Holdover Price is also subject to any Price Component Adjustments.
7. BILLING AND FEES. Each month, Customer shall pay the NextEra Energy Services Electricity Charge (as defined herein). Unless the Parties agree in writing to alternate payment arrangements, Customer consents to be billed monthly for services provided hereunder through one of the following billing options, as permitted by law, at NextEra Energy Services' discretion: (i) Customer will receive one invoice from the LDU that includes the NextEra Energy Services Electricity Charge, the Delivery Charges and applicable Taxes and Add-On Charges (the "Consolidated Billing Option"); or (ii) Customer will receive two invoices, one from NextEra Energy Services for the NextEra Energy Services Electricity Charge and one from the LDU for the Delivery Charges, each with applicable Taxes and Add-On Charges (the "Dual Billing Option"). Under the Consolidated Billing Option, Customer will make payments directly to the LDU pursuant to the applicable LDU tariff. Under the Dual Billing Option, payments are due to NextEra Energy Services within sixteen (16) days from the date of the invoice. If, under the Consolidated Billing Option or Dual Billing Option, any payment for the NextEra Energy Services Electricity Charge made by Customer to NextEra Energy Services or to the LDU is late under the applicable payment terms, Customer may be assessed the Late Fee and its delinquent balances may be reported to a credit agency. Further, in addition to any other rights of NextEra Energy Services hereunder, if, during the Dual Billing Option, any payment for the NextEra Energy Services Electricity Charge is late under the applicable payment terms, then NextEra Energy Services shall have the right, without prior notice to the customer, to convert all billing hereunder to the Consolidated Billing Option and convert the Price as necessary, on a commercial reasonable basis, to a unit price sufficient to enable such Consolidated Billing. NextEra Energy Services may apply any credit balance on a particular Account to a balance owed on any other Customer Account. NextEra Energy Services may assess a twenty five dollar (\$25) fee against any transaction not processed due to insufficient funds or credit availability for any method of payment, including checks, bank drafts or credit card. If the LDU fails to timely obtain or transmit a meter reading, NextEra Energy Services will issue or cause to be issued a bill to Customer based on its estimated Energy Usage and charges during the Billing Period. NextEra Energy Services will include or cause to be included in any subsequent bill from NextEra Energy Services, adjustments related to previous billings, including estimates, previous billing errors, meter read errors, or other errors or omissions. In the event that Customer disputes a bill for the NextEra Energy Services Electricity Charge, Customer must pay any undisputed portion of the bill by the due date specified in the applicable payment terms. If the unpaid, disputed portion of the bill is subsequently resolved in favor of NextEra Energy Services, the Late Fee will be applied to such unpaid amounts.
8. DISPUTES OR COMPLAINTS. Customer should contact NextEra Energy Services at 866-319-4392 (toll free) with any questions or complaints regarding its generation service or bills for the NextEra Energy Services Electricity Charge. Customer should contact its LDU directly in the event of a power outage or if Customer has questions regarding the Delivery Charges on its bill.
9. CREDIT AND DEPOSIT REQUIREMENTS. NextEra Energy Services reserves the right to request a credit history on an applicant for service prior to offering service and to refuse service to anyone who does not meet NextEra Energy Services' credit standards. If NextEra Energy Services determines, prior to offering service or at any time during the term of this Agreement, that Customer's credit is unsatisfactory, NextEra Energy Services has the right to require Customer to make alternate payment or credit arrangements to ensure prompt payment of amounts owed or otherwise payable under this Agreement including, without limitation, the posting of an initial or subsequent security deposit, or an increase in the amount of the deposit. In addition, if Customer's Energy Usage increases during the term of this Agreement, NextEra Energy Services may require a security deposit or an increase in the amount of an existing security deposit. The posting or amount of any security deposit hereunder shall be subject to any limitations imposed by applicable law. A security deposit in the form of cash that is held for more than six months from the date of deposit shall earn simple interest thereon at the rate payable on two-year, United States Treasury notes. A security deposit shall be refunded by means of a credit to Customer's bill once Customer has made twenty-four (24) consecutive payments without assessment of any Late Fees. Upon termination of service, NextEra Energy Services will apply any security deposit plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon toward any outstanding balance on Customer's final bill and will refund any remaining security deposit.

10. TERMINATION OF AGREEMENT BY CUSTOMER. If Customer terminates this Agreement, in whole or as relating to any single Account(s), before the end of the Initial Term, Customer shall pay NextEra Energy Services the Early Termination Fee. In addition, if Customer terminates this Agreement with less than thirty (30) days advance written notice, Customer shall be assessed the Insufficient Notice Fee. In the event that Customer terminates this Agreement as provided for in this Section, Customer shall be obligated to pay for the electricity and related services provided to Customer pursuant to this Agreement prior to the date that such termination becomes effective, including Late Fees, if applicable. Should NextEra Energy Services incur damages greater than the Early Termination Fee as a result of such termination of this Agreement by Customer before the end of the Initial Term, Customer shall pay to NextEra Energy Services such damages. Such damages will be calculated based upon the net present value of the product of (i) the difference between the Price and the market prices that are commercially available to NextEra Energy Services for the same quantities of energy which would have been supplied hereunder for the remainder of the Initial Term, and (ii) the estimated Energy Usage by Customer, as determined by NextEra Energy Services, during the remainder of the Initial Term. To determine "market prices", as used above, NextEra Energy Services may consider, among other things, settlement prices of applicable NYMEX power futures contracts, quotations from leading dealers in energy swap contracts and other bona fide offers from parties participating in the wholesale and/or retail power markets, which may include NextEra Energy Services and/or its affiliates, all as commercially available to NextEra Energy Services and all as adjusted for the length of the remaining Initial Term and differences in transmission costs and volume. NextEra Energy Services will not be required to enter into any replacement transaction in order to determine such market prices or actual damages. The Parties agree that the amounts recoverable hereunder are a reasonable estimate of loss and not a penalty.
11. TERMINATION OF AGREEMENT BY NEXTERA ENERGY SERVICES. NextEra Energy Services reserves the right to terminate this Agreement if Customer: (i) fails to make timely payment of all amounts due NextEra Energy Services; or (ii) fails to post a security deposit under the provisions of the Credit and Deposit Requirements Section herein within ten (10) days of a request for deposit; or (iii) breaches any warranty or representation to NextEra Energy Services; or (iv) defaults on any material obligation under this Agreement; or (v)(A) makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors, (B) files a petition or otherwise authorizes the commencement of a proceeding under the Bankruptcy Code or similar law for protection of creditors, or has such petition filed against it, (C) otherwise becomes bankrupt or insolvent, or (D) is unable to pay its debts as they fall due; or (vi) enters into a merger with, or sells substantially all of its assets to, another entity that fails to assume Customer's obligations under this Agreement. Termination of electric service for space heating purposes during the months of November through March are subject to timing and notice requirements provided in Sections 8-202, 8-203 and 8-205 of the IPUA. In the event service is terminated in accordance with this Section, Customer shall pay the Early Termination Fee or, if applicable, damages incurred by NextEra Energy Services as provided in this Agreement. NextEra Energy Services will notify Customer of its intent to terminate service at least ten (10) days prior to the effective date of termination and, unless another competitive electricity supplier is chosen by Customer, Customer's electricity will be provided by the LDU under its applicable generation service tariff.
12. TITLE, RISK OF LOSS AND INDEMNIFICATION. Title and risk of loss to the electricity sold hereunder shall pass from NextEra Energy Services to Customer when it is delivered to the Delivery Point for each Account(s). Customer shall indemnify and defend NextEra Energy Services from all claims for any loss, damage, or injury to persons or property, including without limitation all consequential, incidental, exemplary, or punitive damages arising from or relating to the distribution or consumption of electricity at and after the point at which the LDU delivers the electricity to Customer's facilities to which the Account(s) pertain.
13. FORCE MAJEURE. In the event that either Party's performance of its obligations under this Agreement, other than payment obligations, is interrupted or delayed by any occurrence not caused by either Party, whether such occurrence is an act of God or public enemy, or whether such occurrence is caused by storm, earthquake, or other natural forces, or by war, riot, public disturbance, labor action, or the acts or omissions of anyone not a Party to this Agreement, then the Party affected by such occurrence shall be excused from such performance and any further performance required under this Agreement for whatever period is reasonably necessary to remedy the effects of that occurrence.
14. CHANGE IN LAW. In the event that there is a Change in Law and such Change in Law results in NextEra Energy Services incurring additional costs and expenses in providing the services contemplated herein, such additional costs and expenses shall be the Customer's responsibility and will be assessed to Customer in NextEra Energy Services' monthly bills as an additional Pass-Through Charge.

15. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. Each Party warrants and represents to the other Party that: (i) it is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its formation; (ii) it is authorized and qualified to do business in the jurisdictions necessary to perform this Agreement; (iii) the execution, verbal authorization, delivery and performance of this Agreement have been duly and validly authorized by all necessary corporate or other actions and do not violate any agreement to which it is a party or any laws or regulations applicable to it; and (iv) the Agreement, when delivered, will be valid and legally binding upon it and enforceable in accordance with its respective terms (subject to equitable defenses). Customer further warrants and represents to NextEra Energy Services that it has full power and authority over the provision of electricity to the facilities to which the Account(s) pertain.
16. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

THE LIMITATIONS IMPOSED ON REMEDIES AND DAMAGE MEASUREMENT WILL BE WITHOUT REGARD TO CAUSE, INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OF ANY PARTY, WHETHER SOLE, JOINT, CONCURRENT, ACTIVE OR PASSIVE, PROVIDED NO SUCH LIMITATION SHALL APPLY TO DAMAGES RESULTING FROM WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OF ANY PARTY.
18. FORWARD CONTRACT. The Parties agree that this Agreement is a "forward contract" and that NextEra Energy Services is a "forward contract merchant" for purposes of the United States Bankruptcy Code, as amended, (the "Bankruptcy Code") and that any payment related hereto will constitute a "settlement payment" as defined in Section 101 (51A) of the Bankruptcy Code.
19. ATTORNEY'S FEES. If Customer fails to timely pay amounts due under this Agreement and NextEra Energy Services refers Customer's outstanding balance to an attorney or collection agent for collection, or if NextEra Energy Services files a lawsuit in connection with this Agreement, or collects Customer's outstanding balance through bankruptcy or judicial proceedings, Customer agrees to pay NextEra Energy Services its reasonable fees and expenses (including reasonable attorney's fees) incurred by NextEra Energy Services in connection therewith.
20. AMENDMENT. This Agreement may not be amended except by a written amendment signed by both Customer and NextEra Energy Services.
