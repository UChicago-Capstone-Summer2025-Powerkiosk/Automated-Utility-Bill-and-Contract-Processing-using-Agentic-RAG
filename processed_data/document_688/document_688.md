You may see PSE\&G representatives in your neighborhood this summer. As part of our efforts to support our customers as we recover from the financial impacts of the pandemic, we will be distributing information and applications for payment assistance. PSE\&G representatives will carry an identification card with their picture on it.

PSE\&G's new smart meters are protected by a comprehensive cybersecurity plan. We will only use the data obtained through smart meters to provide better service to customers and we will not sell the data to third parties. Smart meters also do not collect, store or transmit any personal information. To learn more, visit pseg.com/smartmeters

Beware of payment scams. If you receive a phone call demanding immediate bill payment with Bitcoin or a prepaid card, or offering you a bill discount due to a good payment history, it is a scam. When in doubt, hang up and call the number listed on your bill: 1-800-436-7734. For more information, visit pseg.com/scamalert.
