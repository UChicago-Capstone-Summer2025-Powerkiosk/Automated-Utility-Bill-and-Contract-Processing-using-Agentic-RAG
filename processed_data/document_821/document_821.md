Upon mutual agreement, Customer has the ability to blend the current rate with a future rate as part of an Agreement extension throughout the term of this Agreement.

PJM has suspended its Unforced Capacity auction for the delivery period beginning June 2025, creating material uncertainty in PJM's capacity price and auction rules from that point forward. Once PJM finalizes these charges, SmartestEnergy US LLC reserves the right to pass through its actual unforced capacity costs/credits beginning June 2025. If its costs change, SmartestEnergy US LLC will have the right to change the prices for components listed in the table above, except for the "Energy" component, beginning 36 months from the execution date of this Agreement.

| Amount of Early Termination Fee and Method of Calculation | ETF shall equal the projected amount of electricity to be consumed by customer for the remainder of the Term multiplied by the difference between the contract price in effect for the remainder of the Term and the price at which SmartestEnergy US LLC can sell such electricity following the termination, or $\$ 500$ per non-residential account, whichever is greater. <br> Agreement is based on the energy consumption used in the prior year. A deviation of $100 \%$ or more could result in additional fees for all commercial customers. See section 9 - Customer Usage Deviation. |
| Amount of Late Payment | If SmartestEnergy US LLC manages billing, customer shall pay 1.5\%, or the highest percentage or amount allowable by law, per month on overdue balances. If the EDC manages billing, customer shall be responsible to pay any late fees charged by the EDC on overdue balances. |
| Credit Support | If this Agreement requires Customer to provide a cash deposit, letter of credit, or prepayment, the amounts and due dates of such instrument(s) shall be detailed on Attachment B. If a deposit or prepayment is required, Customer's signature on Attachment B will indicate its authorization for SmartestEnergy US LLC to access the required funds via ACH debit payment.

This information may be used by SEUS to determine whether it will commence and/or continue to provide energy supply service to Customer and will not be disclosed to a third party unless required by law. Customer's execution of this Agreement shall constitute authorization for the release of this information to SEUS. SEUS reserves the right to refuse to provide service to Customer under this Agreement if it is unable to obtain the necessary Customer Information or it obtains Customer Information that it considers unsatisfactory. This authorization will remain in effect during any initial or renewal term of this Agreement; provided, however, that Customer may rescind this authorization at any time by providing written notice to SEUS or by calling SEUS at 1-800-448-0995. SEUS reserves the right to cancel this Agreement in the event Customer rescinds such authorization. The data obtained pursuant to this authorization will be retained by SEUS for a period of four years post-termination of this Agreement consistent with the statute of limitations for contractual disputes and may be used by SEUS in connection with any ongoing business or legal purpose with respect to its obligations under the Agreement, or to offer additional products or services to Customer during the Term or at any time in the four year period after the Agreement terminates, or as contained in any derivative work created by SEUS in association with its business as a retail energy provider.

CUSTOMER ACKNOWLEDGES THE FOLLOWING: THAT ANY SALES REPRESENTATIVE WITH WHOM CUSTOMER HAS SPOKEN REPRESENTS SEUS, AND IS NOT FROM THE EDC; THAT YOU ARE THE CUSTOMER WHOSE NAME IS ON THE ACCOUNT, THAT YOUR EDC WILL CONTINUE TO DELIVER YOUR ELECTRICITY; THAT YOU HAVE RECEIVED A COPY OF SEUS'S TERMS AND CONDITIONS, AND THE CUSTOMER DISCLOSURE STATEMENT; AND, THAT YOU WERE INFORMED THAT THE EDC MAY DISCONNECT YOUR SERVICE AS A RESULT OF ANY FAILURE TO PAY SEUS'S CHARGES.
5. Term and Termination.
a. For all products except Variable. This Agreement will begin upon the date the parties executed this Agreement (the "Execution Date"). It will continue for the period set forth in the Customer Disclosure Statement (the "Term") from the first meter read date after the EDC processes the Customer's enrollment with SEUS (the "Start Date"). SEUS shall not be held responsible for any delays in the Start Date caused by the actions or inactions of the EDC. After the end of the

Initial Term, this Agreement will automatically continue at a variable rate methodology unless and until this Agreement is terminated by either party.
i. Variable Rate Methodology: After the Term, the rate for electricity will be a variable rate that may be higher or lower each month based on the cost of supply and will be set in SEUS's sole discretion. The variable rate may be higher or lower than your EDC rate or other suppliers' rates.
b. Variable Service. This Agreement will begin on the date the parties executed this Agreement (the "Execution Date") and will continue unless and until this Agreement is terminated by either party. SEUS will begin supplying electricity to Customer on the first meter read date after the EDC processes the Customer's enrollment with SEUS (the "Start Date"). SEUS shall not be held responsible for any delays in the Start Date caused by the actions or inactions of the EDC.
c. Termination

Fees.
ETF shall equal the projected amount of electricity to be consumed by customer for the remainder of the Term multiplied by the difference between the contract price in effect for the remainder of the Term and the price at which SmartestEnergy US LLC can sell such electricity following the termination, or $\$ 500$ per non-residential account, whichever is greater. There are no early termination fees for Variable Service customers. For all other products, the projected amount of electricity to be consumed by customer for the remainder of the Term, multiplied by the difference between the contract price in effect for the remainder of the Term and the price at which SEUS can sell such electricity following the termination, or $\$ 500$ per account, whichever is greater. SEUS may terminate this agreement early for Customer fails to, i.) pay invoices timely ii.) provide performance assurance when requested, as provided in Sections 7 and 22, iii.) provide the notifications of behind the meter generation, net metering transactions or a state power allocation as required in Section 9, or iv.) provide credit support (if applicable) when due as specified in Attachment B or Section 23. If either Party terminates this Agreement early, then Customer shall owe an Early Termination Fee.
6. Price. The Price for all electricity under this Agreement shall be calculated as described in the Customer Disclosure Statement. For each billing cycle, the Price shall be applied to the Customer's metered usage for such billing cycle (as reported by the EDC).
7. Renewable Energy Products. This paragraph applies if Customer has chosen to receive a voluntary renewable energy product, as outlined in the Customer Disclosure Label. This product bundles electricity with Renewable Energy Certificates ("RECs") in an amount designed to match the Customer's usage. A REC represents the environmental benefits of 1 megawatt hour (MWh) of renewable energy that can be paired with electricity. This product is Green-e ${ }^{\circledR}$ Energy certified and meets the environmental and consumer-protection standards set forth by the nonprofit Center for Resource Solutions. Learn more at www.green-e.org. Election of this product supports the development of renewable

2. Billing and Payment. At SEUS's option, Customer may receive a single bill for both commodity and delivery costs from either SEUS or the EDC ("Consolidated Bill"), or the EDC and SEUS may each invoice Customer separately ("Dual Bill"). SEUS will have the right to change the bill type one time during the term of this Agreement. Customer will pay SEUS for electric supply service based on meter readings and consumption information measured by and/or received from Customer's EDC ("Billing Quantity"). For invoices received from SEUS, Customer will pay each invoice in full within 20 days of the invoice date or be subject to a late payment charge of $1.5 \%$, or the highest percentage or amount allowable by law, per month. For invoices received from the EDC, Customer will pay each invoice in full as required by EDC's tariff or be subject to a late payment charge as required by EDC's tariff. If Customer fails to pay either any EDC invoice or any SEUS invoice when due, then, in addition to any other remedies that it may have, SEUS may terminate this Agreement upon 15 calendar days' written notice to Customer. Failure to make full payment of SEUS and EDC charges due on any Consolidated Bill will be grounds for disconnection of EDC services. If any payments made by you directly to us are rejected two (2) times in a one-year period, the only form of payment acceptable will be a certified check, money order, or electronic funds transfer. If you make a payment for a lesser amount, which includes a statement or letter indicating that the lesser payment constitutes full payment, we may accept such payment without prejudice to any other rights or remedies that we may have against you and we may apply it to your account(s) as a partial payment.
3. Customer Usage Deviation and Behind the Meter Generation. If Customer's metered usage during any billing period exceeds, or falls below, its historic usage during a like billing period by $100 \%$ or more, and such variation results in SEUS incurring additional charges, Customer will be responsible for the payment of such additional charges. Customer agrees to inform SEUS of any existing self-generation unit(s), any net metering transactions or any state power allocations associated with the Customer accounts included in this Agreement prior to execution of this Agreement. If Customer fails to provide such notification, SEUS may change the Customer's price or terminate this Agreement. Subsequent to the execution of this Agreement, Customer agrees to promptly provide SEUS with advanced written notice once Customer decides to implement any of the following: (i) changes its use of self-generation unit(s), (ii) installation of additional selfgeneration unit(s); or (iii) addition or amendment of a net metering transaction or state power allocation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Customer shall reimburse SEUS for any costs incurred by SEUS as a result of Customer making any of the changes identified in this paragraph or increases in Customer's capacity or transmission tag due to reduced customer generation output during a tag setting period.. For the avoidance of doubt, consumption bandwidth thresholds established above shall not apply in a manner that would duplicate Customer's cost reimbursement obligations when calculating costs pursuant to this section.
4. Delivery Point, Title, and Taxes. All electricity sold pursuant to this Agreement shall be delivered to a location ("Delivery Point"), which shall constitute the point at which the sale occurs and title
to the energy passes to you from us. Customer will be liable for and pay all taxes or surcharges, which are imposed with respect to the sale of electricity. If Customer is exempt from such taxes, Customer is responsible for identifying and requesting any exemption from the collection of the taxes by providing appropriate documentation to SEUS. Failure to provide appropriate documentation will result in Customer being charged tax until a completed form is on file and accepted by the EDC. Customer will also be responsible to arrange for any tax refunds directly with the state taxing authority.
5. Emergency Services. The EDC will continue to respond to emergencies. In the event of an electricity emergency or service interruption, contact your EDC.
6. Termination. Customer acknowledges that in the event of a cancellation or termination of this Agreement, it may take several billing cycles for Customer to return to the EDC for commodity supply service. Customer remains liable for all SEUS charges until Customer's switch to the EDC or another supplier is effective. A final bill will be rendered within 45 days after the final scheduled meter reading by the EDC or if access is unavailable, an estimate of usage will be used in lieu of the final bill, which will be trued-up when the final meter reading is provided.
7. SEUS Contact Information. Customer may contact SEUS by phone at 1-800-448-0995 Monday through Friday between the hours of 9:00 A.M. to 5:00 P.M.
