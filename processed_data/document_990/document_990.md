The image is a bar chart.

- The chart is horizontal with a gradient color transition from blue to green.
- The x-axis is labeled with dollar amounts: $0, $2,428, $4,856, $7,284, $9,712, and $12,140.
- The text below the chart reads: "Your gas supplier is Eversource."

## News For You

Beginning Nov. 1, adjustments to delivery rates and the seasonal, peak natural gas supply rate took effect. If your bill contains any usage prior to Nov. 1, your rates will reflect pricing from both periods. We understand that a rate increase during the winter heating season is challenging. Visit eversource.com/gas-programs for information about programs and services that can help you manage your bill and control your usage.

## News For You

Beginning Nov. 1, adjustments to delivery rates and the seasonal, peak natural gas supply rate took effect. If your bill contains any usage prior to Nov. 1, your rates will reflect pricing from both periods. We understand that a rate increase during the winter heating season is challenging. Visit eversource.com/gas-programs for information about programs and services that can help you manage your bill and control your usage.
