Responsibility for gas piping. The customer is responsible for the maintenance of all gas piping from the gas meter to all gas appliances. Buried gas piping that is not maintained is subjected to potential hazards of corrosion and leakage. For your safety, all buried gas piping should be periodically inspected for leaks. If the buried piping is metallic, it should also be periodically inspected for corrosion. If an unsafe condition is found, the gas piping will need to be promptly repaired.
When digging near buried gas piping, the piping must be located in advance and digging should be done by hand. Plumbing and heating contractors can assist in locating, inspecting and repairing customers' buried pipelines. State law requires that you must call at least two (2) full working days before you dig. Always call 811 before you dig.

## Know the signs and stay safe around carbon monoxide!

![](images/img-3.jpeg)

The image is a photo showing a carbon monoxide alarm mounted on a wall with a blue dotted pattern. A hand is pressing the "TEST/MENU" button on the alarm. The alarm has a digital display showing "000 ppm" and three indicator lights labeled "POWER," "FAULT," and "ALARM." Text on the alarm reads: "CARBON MONOXIDE ALARM," "CAUTION," and "READ THE INSTRUCTIONS CAREFULLY BEFORE OPERATING OR SERVICING. DO NOT PAINT."

Carbon monoxide (CO) safety is crucial because CO is a colorless, odorless gas that can be deadly when inhaled in high concentrations.

Symptoms of exposure: Exposure to carbon monoxide can lead to symptoms such as headaches, dizziness, nausea, confusion and even loss of consciousness. Prolonged exposure can be fatal.

Early warning devices: Install and/or test the carbon monoxide detectors in your home. These devices can alert you to the presence of carbon monoxide before it reaches dangerous levels.

Ventilation: Make sure all combustion appliances are adequately maintained and properly vented according to manufacturer's specifications. This includes gas stoves, fireplaces, furnaces and water heaters.

When cooking with any type of stove, it's important to implement tips for safe cooking:

- Make sure appliances are installed, maintained and inspected by a qualified contractor.
- Turn on exhaust fans when cooking.
- Do not use your stove as a space heater and only use it to cook.
- Use carbon monoxide detection devices.

# A safety message from CenterPoint Energy

## How to read your meter

![](images/img-7.jpeg)

The image is a diagram showing four dials used for reading a meter index. Each dial has numbers ranging from 0 to 9, with arrows indicating the direction of reading. The dials are labeled from right to left as follows:

1. "1,000" dial: The pointer is near the number 7, with a clockwise arrow.
2. "10,000" dial: The pointer is near the number 9, with a counterclockwise arrow.
3. "100,000" dial: The pointer is near the number 2, with a clockwise arrow.
4. "1,000,000" dial: The pointer is near the number 6, with a counterclockwise arrow.

The entire meter reading is indicated as 6187.

The following is an example of how to read a typical meter index.
Look at the four dials with their curved arrows. Read from right to left as follows:

1. Read the "thousand-foot" dial as 7 , the last number that the pointer passed. Note that the curved arrow on the dial shows a clockwise movement of the pointer.
2. Read the next dial, the "10-thousand" dial. The curved arrow on the dial above shows a

Si percibes un olor a gas natural, sal inmediatamente. Llama a nuestra lÃ­nea telefÃ³nica para fugas de gas a uno de los nÃºmeros de telÃ©fono que aparecen arriba. No use ni almacene productos inflamables tales como gasolina en la misma habitaciÃ³n o en Ã¡reas cercanas a un calentador de agua u otro tipo de aparato a gas.
counterclockwise direction. The pointer is near the 9 , but to be sure whether to read it as that number or the lower number 8 , the previously mentioned "same or lower number rule" must be applied. Since the pointer in the "thousand-foot" dial to the right is nearer the 8 and the pointer has not reached the 0 , the " 10 -thousand" dial should be read as 8 .
3. Read the "100-thousand" dial, it seems to point to 2 . Double-check by using the rule above. Since the pointer of the "10-thousand" dial is between 8 and 9 , take the lower reading number, 1 , for the "100-thousand" dial.
4. Read the left-most dial, the "million-foot" dial. The pointer is near the 6 . Using the "same or lower number rule", we find the pointer on the dial to the right is between 1 and 2 , so we read the "million-foot" dial exactly as the number it is on or near, 6 .
The entire meter reading is 6187 .
