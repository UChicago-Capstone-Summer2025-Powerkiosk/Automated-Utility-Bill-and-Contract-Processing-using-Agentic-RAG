{{table_data: table-0.csv}}

Percent Energy and Index Energy: The Percent Energy Price in Table 1 shall apply to the Percent Product Quantity elected at the time of execution ("Percent Energy"). Such Percent Energy represents a percentage of Customer's full requirements energy in any and all hours of operation. Index Energy, if any, is the quantity of metered usage during any hour of delivery that exceeds the Percent Energy ("Index Energy") and is calculated by applying the sum of the Percent Energy to the total kWh in any hour, and subtracting that amount from Customer's total hourly-metered energy quantity. The hourly price for Index Energy (the "Index Energy Price") will equal the sum of the RTO Day Ahead Locational Marginal Price for the Utility zone ("DA LMP") and the Index Energy Price Adder indicated in Table 1. If during the Term of this Agreement the DA LMP ceases to exist then its replacement index shall be used for the remaining Term of the Agreement. On an hourly basis all Percent Energy kWh deliveries will be metered before any Index Energy kWh deliveries.

The Percent Energy Price and the Index Energy Price include charges for energy, scheduling and load forecasting associated with the delivery of Percent Energy and Index Energy. The Percent Energy Price may include distribution energy losses if elected in Table 1. The Percent Energy Price and Index Energy Price do not include transmission, or capacity nor do they apply to any charges assessed by DSP, all of which are the responsibility of Customer, including, but not limited to the following: charges for services under DSP's applicable delivery service tariffs and riders, facilities charges, taxes (either billed by DSP or customer self-assessed) and other DSP charges, including but not limited to fuel, environmental, or decommissioning charges, as may be applicable from time to time. On-Peak and Off-Peak pricing, if applicable, shall be applied for such periods as follows: 1) On-Peak Period means the hours from 6 A.M. until 10 P.M. Central Prevailing Time ("CPT"), Monday through Friday except New Year's Day, Memorial Day, Fourth of July, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day or if one of the preceding holidays occurs on a Sunday, the Monday immediately following the holiday and 2) Off-Peak Period means all hours other than those included in the Peak Period.

Distribution Losses: Charges for distribution energy losses will be included in the Percent Energy Price or as a Pass-Through which will appear as a separate line item on Customer's monthly invoice and calculated by applying the distribution energy loss factor indicated under DSP's applicable delivery service tariffs to the metered kilowatt-hours ("kWh") each hour.

If a quantity of $100 \%$ is elected and Distribution Losses are Pass-Through, Distribution Losses charge will be billed at the Percent Energy Price.
If a quantity other than $100 \%$ is elected, Distribution Losses will automatically be a Pass-Through and billed at the Index Energy Price.

Transmission: Customer acknowledges that Supplier will incur RTO transmission charges on Customer's behalf to deliver Retail Power to the Delivery Point. Charges for transmission are based upon the RTO's Open Access Transmission Tariff ("OATT") and business practices for the DSP zone. Charges will appear as a separate line item on Customer's monthly invoice and shall be billed as follows.

If the Transmission Charge in Table 1 is a fixed number, then the cents/kilowatt-hour charge noted in Table 1 will apply to all metered kWh throughout the Term. If the RTO business practices and policies or other applicable transmission tariffs or business practices and policies are amended or otherwise implemented during the Term of this Agreement, notwithstanding the terms and conditions of Section 7 of the Agreement, Supplier will change the Transmission Charge accordingly. Supplier shall be permitted to retroactively charge Customer the amended Transmission Charge.
If the Transmission Charge in Table 1 is noted as Pass-Through, then the monthly charge will be dependent upon 1) the current rate charged by RTO at time Retail Power is delivered, 2) Customer's peak demand (or peak load) as determined by RTO, and 3) depending upon the RTO, the number of days in the billing period or the number of months per year. Supplier will be invoiced directly by the RTO for service and Customer agrees to pay to Supplier the Transmission Charge.
Ancillary Services: Customer acknowledges that Supplier (as the RTO Market Participant) will incur market related charges regarding ancillary services as set forth in the applicable RTO OATT and for other RTO costs not otherwise included in any of the defined cost components in this Agreement ("Ancillary Services"). The cents/kilowatt-hour charge noted in Table 1 will appear as a separate line item on Customer's monthly invoice. If the applicable RTO business practices and policies or other applicable transmission tariffs or business practices and policies are amended or otherwise implemented during the Term of this Agreement, notwithstanding the terms and conditions of Section 7 of the Agreement, Supplier will change the Ancillary Services Charge accordingly. Supplier shall be permitted to retroactively charge Customer the amended Ancillary Services Charge.
Capacity Charge: Supplier will secure capacity relative to the supply of all Retail Power during the Term of this Agreement in accordance with the RTO business practices, policies, rules, regulations, or tariffs. Charges for capacity will appear as a separate line item on Customer's monthly invoice and shall be billed as follows.

If the Capacity Charge in Table 1 is a fixed number, then the cents/kilowatt-hour charge noted in Table 1 will apply to all metered kWh throughout the Term.
If the Capacity Charge in Table 1 is noted as Pass-Through, then the monthly charge will be dependent upon 1) Customer's then current capacity obligation, or Capacity Peak Load Contribution ("PLC") as determined by DSP including any applicable Utility zoning factors, 2) the Final Zonal Capacity Prices (the "Current Capacity Rate") as determined by RTO, and 3) the number of days in the billing period.
Mandatory Renewable Portfolio Charge ("RPS"): The Illinois Public Utilities Act requires that all Illinois Alternative Retail Electric Suppliers ("ARES") have renewable energy sources as a percentage of their supply portfolio. The RPS Charge identified in Table 1 represents Supplier's charge for compliance with such Act. If during the Term of this Agreement any rule, regulation, tariff, ordinance, statute, or law affecting the Supplier's obligation pertaining to renewable energy resources are amended or otherwise implemented by the applicable regulatory agency, and Supplier can verify to Customer that the change has a material effect on Supplier's costs of procuring renewable energy then, notwithstanding the terms and conditions of Section 7 of the Agreement, Supplier will change the RPS Charge and add or reduce such charges incurred on Customer's behalf to comply with the change in effect during the corresponding period, as applicable.
Additional Voluntary Renewable Energy Charge: If selected in Table 1, Customer's monthly invoice shall include a line item equal to the cents/kilowatt-hour charge noted in Table 1 for all metered kWh throughout the Term. Retail Power shall be associated with the generation of electricity from a renewable energy resource such that the percentage required, when added to Customer's obligation under the RPS of this Agreement, shall equal the Voluntary Renewable Quantity (\%) selected in Table 1. The renewable energy resource shall be selected by Supplier from any of the sources listed and provided for in 20 ILCS 687/6-3(f), as may be amended from time to time. In relation thereto, Supplier shall retire a sufficient number of Renewable Energy Certificates that will correspond to the Total Renewable Energy Commitment, as a portion of the Retail Power delivered in a given billing cycle. "Renewable Energy Certificate" or "REC" means a certificate, credit, allowance, green tag, or other transferable indicia howsoever entitled, created by a program or certification authority recognized by the RTO or the applicable agency of the State in which the Account is located, indicating generation of a particular quantity of energy, or product associated with the generation of a specified quantity of energy from a renewable energy source. A REC may include some or all additional environmental attributes associated with the generation of electricity, and those environmental attributes may, but need not be, verified or certified by the same or Illinois C\&I

different verification authorities or certification authorities that originally recognized the REC. The Parties agree and understand a REC is separate from the Retail Power being delivered but, nonetheless, constitutes value associated with the provision of Retail Power. At the request of Customer, Supplier will provide related information pertaining to the REC, including the identity of the renewable energy resource, the date of creation and retirement of the REC, and the identity of the renewable energy facility. The delivery of additional voluntary renewable energy shall begin in the first billing cycle that follows the execution of this Agreement.
Percent Product Quantity: If a quantity other than $100 \%$ is elected in Table 1, then upon Customer's request, Supplier will provide Customer with a written price quote for Customer's uncommitted/remaining load. Such requests shall be made in $25 \%$ increments of Customer's annual load profile, up to the full uncommitted portion of Customer's annual load, not to exceed $100 \%$. If Customer wishes to accept a quote, then Supplier will issue a Confirmation Letter setting forth the price, duration and the portion of Customer's hourly load (excluding the initial volume or load set forth in the Agreement) to which the Confirmation Letter will be applicable. Customer may elect to accept any such Confirmation Letter prior to midnight on the day it is issued by signing and returning said written confirmation. Upon written acceptance by Customer and Supplier, the Confirmation Letter will then be incorporated as part of this Agreement. In the event Customer fails to confirm 100 percent of load elections prior to the first delivery of retail power under this Agreement, any uncommitted load shall be priced as Index Energy, as described above. Customer's resultant Percent Energy Price for the Term shall then be calculated as the weighted average of all Percent Energy Prices confirmed prior to delivery and billed as first through the meter. Then subsequent intra-term elections shall be billed as second through the meter. SUPPLIER DOES NOT GUARANTEE THE RESULTANT WEIGHTED AVERAGE PERCENT ENERGY PRICE WILL BE EQUAL TO OR LESS THAN THE ENERGY PRICE FOR 100\% OF THE LOAD THAT SUPPLIER MAY HAVE OFFERED TO THE CUSTOMER AT THE TIME OF EXECUTION OF THIS AGREEMENT. CUSTOMER AGREES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THE VOLATILITY IN THE RETAIL POWER MARKET AND ACCEPTS THE RISK OF THE HIGHER RESULTANT WEIGHTED AVERAGE POWER PRICE.
Conditional Contingency: This offer is contingent on acceptance by the DSP of Supplier's DASR(s) for all listed accounts.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, subject to any of the foregoing execution conditions, the Parties have executed and delivered this Agreement on the date last signed by the Parties.
