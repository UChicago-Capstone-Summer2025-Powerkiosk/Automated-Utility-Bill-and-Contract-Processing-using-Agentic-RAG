Responsibility for gas piping. The customer is responsible for the maintenance of all gas piping from the gas meter to all gas appliances. Buried gas piping that is not maintained is subject to potential hazards of corrosion and leakage. For your safety, all buried gas piping should be periodically inspected for leaks. If the buried piping is metallic, it should also be periodically inspected for corrosion. If an unsafe condition is found, the gas piping will need to be promptly repaired.

When digging near buried gas piping, the piping must be located in advance and digging should be done by hand. Plumbing and heating contractors can assist in locating, inspecting and repairing customers' buried pipelines. State law requires that you must call at least two (2) full working days before you dig. Always call 811 before you dig.
