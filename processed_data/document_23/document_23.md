# General Terms and Conditions <br> Base Contract for Sale and Purchase of Natural Gas 

## SECTION 1. PURPOSE AND PROCEDURES

1.1. These General Terms and Conditions are intended to facilitate purchase and sale transactions of Gas on a Firm or Interruptible basis. "Buyer" refers to the party receiving Gas and "Seller" refers to the party delivering Gas. The entire agreement between the parties shall be the Contract as defined in Section 2.9.
The parties have selected either the "Oral Transaction Procedure" or the "Written Transaction Procedure" as indicated on the Base Contract.

## Oral Transaction Procedure:

1.2. The parties will use the following Transaction Confirmation procedure. Any Gas purchase and sale transaction may be effectuated in an EDI transmission or telephone conversation with the offer and acceptance constituting the agreement of the parties. The parties shall be legally bound from the time they so agree to transaction terms and may each rely thereon. Any such transaction shall be considered a "writing" and to have been "signed". Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, the parties agree that Confirming Party shall, and the other party may, confirm a telephonic transaction by sending the other party a Transaction Confirmation by facsimile, EDI or mutually agreeable electronic means within three Business Days of a transaction covered by this Section 1.2 (Oral Transaction Procedure) provided that the failure to send a Transaction Confirmation shall not invalidate the oral agreement of the parties. Confirming Party adopts its confirming letterhead, or the like, as its signature on any Transaction Confirmation as the identification and authentication of Confirming Party. If the Transaction Confirmation contains any provisions other than those relating to the commercial terms of the transaction (i.e., price, quantity, performance obligation, delivery point, period of delivery and/or transportation conditions), which modify or supplement the Base Contract or General Terms and Conditions of this Contract (e.g., arbitration or additional representations and warranties), such provisions shall not be deemed to be accepted pursuant to Section 1.3 but must be expressly agreed to by both parties; provided that the foregoing shall not invalidate any transaction agreed to by the parties.

## Written Transaction Procedure:

1.2. The parties will use the following Transaction Confirmation procedure. Should the parties come to an agreement regarding a Gas purchase and sale transaction for a particular Delivery Period, the Confirming Party shall, and the other party may, record that agreement on a Transaction Confirmation and communicate such Transaction Confirmation by facsimile, EDI or mutually agreeable electronic means, to the other party by the close of the Business Day following the date of agreement. The parties acknowledge that their agreement will not be binding until the exchange of nonconflicting Transaction Confirmations or the passage of the Confirm Deadline without objection from the receiving party, as provided in Section 1.3.
1.3. If a sending party's Transaction Confirmation is materially different from the receiving party's understanding of the agreement referred to in Section 1.2, such receiving party shall notify the sending party via facsimile, EDI or mutually agreeable electronic means by the Confirm Deadline, unless such receiving party has previously sent a Transaction Confirmation to the sending party. The failure of the receiving party to so notify the sending party in writing by the Confirm Deadline constitutes the receiving party's agreement to the terms of the transaction described in the sending party's Transaction Confirmation. If there are any material differences between timely sent Transaction Confirmations governing the same transaction, then neither Transaction Confirmation shall be binding until or unless such differences are resolved including the use of any evidence that clearly resolves the differences in the Transaction Confirmations. In the event of a conflict among the terms of (i) a binding Transaction Confirmation pursuant to Section 1.2, (ii) the oral agreement of the parties which may be evidenced by a recorded conversation, where the parties have selected the Oral Transaction Procedure of the Base Contract, (iii) the Base Contract, and (iv) these General Terms and Conditions, the terms of the documents shall govern in the priority listed in this sentence.
1.4. The parties agree that each party may electronically record all telephone conversations with respect to this Contract between their respective employees, without any special or further notice to the other party. Each party shall obtain any necessary consent of its agents and employees to such recording. Where the parties have selected the Oral Transaction Procedure in Section 1.2 of the Base Contract, the parties agree not to contest the validity or enforceability of telephonic recordings entered into in accordance with the requirements of this Base Contract.

## SECTION 2. DEFINITIONS

The terms set forth below shall have the meaning ascribed to them below. Other terms are also defined elsewhere in the Contract and shall have the meanings ascribed to them herein.

2.3. "Alternative Damages" shall mean such damages, expressed in dollars or dollars per MMBtu, as the parties shall agree upon in the Transaction Confirmation, in the event either Seller or Buyer fails to perform a Firm obligation to deliver Gas in the case of Seller or to receive Gas in the case of Buyer.

2.13. "Credit Support Obligation(s)" shall mean any obligation(s) to provide or establish credit support for, or on behalf of, a party to this Contract such as cash, an irrevocable standby letter of credit, a margin agreement, a prepayment, a security interest in an asset, guaranty, or other good and sufficient security of a continuing nature.

The parties have selected either the "Cover Standard" or the "Spot Price Standard" as indicated on the Base Contract.

## Cover Standard:

3.2. The sole and exclusive remedy of the parties in the event of a breach of a Firm obligation to deliver or receive Gas shall be recovery of the following: (i) in the event of a breach by Seller on any Day(s), payment by Seller to Buyer in an amount equal to the positive difference, if any, between the purchase price paid by Buyer utilizing the Cover Standard and the Contract Price, adjusted for commercially reasonable differences in transportation costs to or from the Delivery Point(s), multiplied by the difference between the Contract Quantity and the quantity actually delivered by Seller for such Day(s) excluding any quantity for which no replacement is available; or (ii) in the event of a breach by Buyer on any Day(s), payment by Buyer to Seller in the amount equal to the positive difference, if any, between the Contract Price and the price received by Seller utilizing the Cover Standard for the resale of such Gas, adjusted for commercially reasonable differences in transportation costs to or from the Delivery Point(s), multiplied by the difference between the Contract Quantity and the quantity actually taken by Buyer for such Day(s) excluding any quantity for which no sale is available; and (iii) in the event that Buyer has used commercially reasonable efforts to replace the Gas or Seller has used commercially reasonable efforts to sell the Gas to a third party, and no such replacement or sale is available for all or any portion of the Contract Quantity of Gas, then in addition to (i) or (ii) above, as applicable, the sole and exclusive remedy of the performing party with respect to the Gas not replaced or sold shall be an amount equal to any unfavorable difference between the Contract Price and the Spot Price, adjusted for such transportation to the applicable Delivery Point, multiplied by the quantity of such Gas not replaced or sold. Imbalance Charges shall not be recovered under this Section 3.2, but Seller and/or Buyer shall be responsible for Imbalance Charges, if any, as provided in Section 4.3. The amount of such unfavorable difference shall be payable five Business Days after presentation of the performing party's invoice, which shall set forth the basis upon which such amount was calculated.

# Spot Price Standard: 

3.2. The sole and exclusive remedy of the parties in the event of a breach of a Firm obligation to deliver or receive Gas shall be recovery of the following: (i) in the event of a breach by Seller on any Day(s), payment by Seller to Buyer in an amount equal to the difference between the Contract Quantity and the actual quantity delivered by Seller and received by Buyer for such Day(s), multiplied by the positive difference, if any, obtained by subtracting the Contract Price from the Spot Price; or (ii) in the event of a breach by Buyer on any Day(s), payment by Buyer to Seller in an amount equal to the difference between the Contract Quantity and the actual quantity delivered by Seller and received by Buyer for such Day(s), multiplied by the positive difference, if any, obtained by subtracting the applicable Spot Price from the Contract Price. Imbalance Charges shall not be recovered under this Section 3.2, but Seller and/or Buyer shall be responsible for Imbalance Charges, if any, as provided in Section 4.3. The amount of such unfavorable difference shall be payable five Business Days after presentation of the performing party's invoice, which shall set forth the basis upon which such amount was calculated.
3.3. Notwithstanding Section 3.2, the parties may agree to Alternative Damages in a Transaction Confirmation executed in writing by both parties.
3.4. In addition to Sections 3.2 and 3.3, the parties may provide for a Termination Option in a Transaction Confirmation executed in writing by both parties. The Transaction Confirmation containing the Termination Option will designate the length of nonperformance triggering the Termination Option and the procedures for exercise thereof, how damages for nonperformance will be compensated, and how liquidation costs will be calculated.

## SECTION 4. TRANSPORTATION, NOMINATIONS, AND IMBALANCES

4.1. Seller shall have the sole responsibility for transporting the Gas to the Delivery Point(s). Buyer shall have the sole responsibility for transporting the Gas from the Delivery Point(s).
4.2. The parties shall coordinate their nomination activities, giving sufficient time to meet the deadlines of the affected Transporter(s). Each party shall give the other party timely prior Notice, sufficient to meet the requirements of all Transporter(s) involved in the transaction, of the quantities of Gas to be delivered and purchased each Day. Should either party become aware that actual deliveries at the Delivery Point(s) are greater or lesser than the Scheduled Gas, such party shall promptly notify the other party.
4.3. The parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to avoid imposition of any Imbalance Charges. If Buyer or Seller receives an invoice from a Transporter that includes Imbalance Charges, the parties shall determine the validity as well as the cause of such Imbalance Charges. If the Imbalance Charges were incurred as a result of Buyer's receipt of quantities of Gas greater than or less than the Scheduled Gas, then Buyer shall pay for such Imbalance Charges or reimburse Seller for such Imbalance Charges paid by Seller. If the Imbalance Charges were incurred as a result of Seller's delivery of quantities of Gas greater than or less than the Scheduled Gas, then Seller shall pay for such Imbalance Charges or reimburse Buyer for such Imbalance Charges paid by Buyer.

## SECTION 5. QUALITY AND MEASUREMENT

All Gas delivered by Seller shall meet the pressure, quality and heat content requirements of the Receiving Transporter. The unit of quantity measurement for purposes of this Contract shall be one MMBtu dry. Measurement of Gas quantities hereunder shall be in accordance with the established procedures of the Receiving Transporter.

## SECTION 6. TAXES

The parties have selected either "Buyer Pays At and After Delivery Point" or "Seller Pays Before and At Delivery Point" as indicated on the Base Contract.

## Buyer Pays At and After Delivery Point:

Seller shall pay or cause to be paid all taxes, fees, levies, penalties, licenses or charges imposed by any government authority ("Taxes") on or with respect to the Gas prior to the Delivery Point(s). Buyer shall pay or cause to be paid all Taxes on or with respect to the Gas at the Delivery Point(s) and all Taxes after the Delivery Point(s). If a party is required to remit or pay Taxes that are the other party's responsibility hereunder, the party responsible for such Taxes shall promptly reimburse the other party for such Taxes. Any party entitled to an exemption from any such Taxes or charges shall furnish the other party any necessary documentation thereof.

## Seller Pays Before and At Delivery Point:

Seller shall pay or cause to be paid all taxes, fees, levies, penalties, licenses or charges imposed by any government authority ("Taxes") on or with respect to the Gas prior to the Delivery Point(s) and all Taxes at the Delivery Point(s). Buyer shall pay or cause to be paid all Taxes on or with respect to the Gas after the Delivery Point(s). If a party is required to remit or pay Taxes that are the other party's responsibility hereunder, the party responsible for such Taxes shall promptly reimburse the other party for such Taxes. Any party entitled to an exemption from any such Taxes or charges shall furnish the other party any necessary documentation thereof.

## SECTION 7. BILLING, PAYMENT, AND AUDIT

7.1. Seller shall invoice Buyer for Gas delivered and received in the preceding Month and for any other applicable charges, providing supporting documentation acceptable in industry practice to support the amount charged. If the actual quantity delivered is not known by the billing date, billing will be prepared based on the quantity of Scheduled Gas. The invoiced quantity will then be adjusted to the actual quantity on the following Month's billing or as soon thereafter as actual delivery information is available.

7.2. Buyer shall remit the amount due under Section 7.1 in the manner specified in the Base Contract, in immediately available funds, on or before the later of the Payment Date or 10 Days after receipt of the invoice by Buyer; provided that if the Payment Date is not a Business Day, payment is due on the next Business Day following that date. In the event any payments are due Buyer hereunder, payment to Buyer shall be made in accordance with this Section 7.2.
7.3. In the event payments become due pursuant to Sections 3.2 or 3.3, the performing party may submit an invoice to the nonperforming party for an accelerated payment setting forth the basis upon which the invoiced amount was calculated. Payment from the nonperforming party will be due five Business Days after receipt of invoice.
7.4. If the invoiced party, in good faith, disputes the amount of any such invoice or any part thereof, such invoiced party will pay such amount as it concedes to be correct; provided, however, if the invoiced party disputes the amount due, it must provide supporting documentation acceptable in industry practice to support the amount paid or disputed without undue delay. In the event the parties are unable to resolve such dispute, either party may pursue any remedy available at law or in equity to enforce its rights pursuant to this Section.
7.5. If the invoiced party fails to remit the full amount payable when due, interest on the unpaid portion shall accrue from the date due until the date of payment at a rate equal to the lower of (i) the then-effective prime rate of interest published under "Money Rates" by The Wall Street Journal, plus two percent per annum; or (ii) the maximum applicable lawful interest rate.
7.6. A party shall have the right, at its own expense, upon reasonable Notice and at reasonable times, to examine and audit and to obtain copies of the relevant portion of the books, records, and telephone recordings of the other party only to the extent reasonably necessary to verify the accuracy of any statement, charge, payment, or computation made under the Contract. This right to examine, audit, and to obtain copies shall not be available with respect to proprietary information not directly relevant to transactions under this Contract. All invoices and billings shall be conclusively presumed final and accurate and all associated claims for under- or overpayments shall be deemed waived unless such invoices or billings are objected to in writing, with adequate explanation and/or documentation, within two years after the Month of Gas delivery. All retroactive adjustments under Section 7 shall be paid in full by the party owing payment within 30 Days of Notice and substantiation of such inaccuracy.
7.7. Unless the parties have elected on the Base Contract not to make this Section 7.7 applicable to this Contract, the parties shall net all undisputed amounts due and owing, and/or past due, arising under the Contract such that the party owing the greater amount shall make a single payment of the net amount to the other party in accordance with Section 7; provided that no payment required to be made pursuant to the terms of any Credit Support Obligation or pursuant to Section 7.3 shall be subject to netting under this Section. If the parties have executed a separate netting agreement, the terms and conditions therein shall prevail to the extent inconsistent herewith.

# SECTION 8. TITLE, WARRANTY, AND INDEMNITY 

8.1. Unless otherwise specifically agreed, title to the Gas shall pass from Seller to Buyer at the Delivery Point(s). Seller shall have responsibility for and assume any liability with respect to the Gas prior to its delivery to Buyer at the specified Delivery Point(s). Buyer shall have responsibility for and assume any liability with respect to said Gas after its delivery to Buyer at the Delivery Point(s).
8.2. Seller warrants that it will have the right to convey and will transfer good and merchantable title to all Gas sold hereunder and delivered by it to Buyer, free and clear of all liens, encumbrances, and claims. EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN THIS SECTION 8.2 AND IN SECTION 15.8, ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING ANY WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR OF FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE, ARE DISCLAIMED.
8.3. Seller agrees to indemnify Buyer and save it harmless from all losses, liabilities or claims including reasonable attorneys' fees and costs of court ("Claims"), from any and all persons, arising from or out of claims of title, personal injury (including death) or property damage from said Gas or other charges thereon which attach before title passes to Buyer. Buyer agrees to indemnify Seller and save it harmless from all Claims, from any and all persons, arising from or out of claims regarding payment, personal injury (including death) or property damage from said Gas or other charges thereon which attach after title passes to Buyer.
8.4. The parties agree that the delivery of and the transfer of title to all Gas under this Contract shall take place within the Customs Territory of the United States (as defined in general note 2 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States 19 U.S.C. §1202, General Notes, page 3); provided, however, that in the event Seller took title to the Gas outside the Customs Territory of the United States, Seller represents and warrants that it is the importer of record for all Gas entered and delivered into the United States, and shall be responsible for entry and entry summary filings as well as the payment of duties, taxes and fees, if any, and all applicable record keeping requirements.
8.5. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Section 8, as between Seller and Buyer, Seller will be liable for all Claims to the extent that such arise from the failure of Gas delivered by Seller to meet the quality requirements of Section 5.

Notices sent by facsimile shall be deemed to have been received upon the sending party's receipt of its facsimile machine's confirmation of successful transmission.

# SECTION 10. FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY 

10.1. If either party (" $X$ ") has reasonable grounds for insecurity regarding the performance of any obligation under this Contract (whether or not then due) by the other party ("Y") (including, without limitation, the occurrence of a material change in the creditworthiness of $Y$ or its Guarantor, if applicable), $X$ may demand Adequate Assurance of Performance. "Adequate Assurance of Performance" shall mean sufficient security in the form, amount, for a term, and from an issuer, all as reasonably acceptable to $X$, including, but not limited to cash, a standby irrevocable letter of credit, a prepayment, a security interest in an asset or guaranty. Y hereby grants to $X$ a continuing first priority security interest in, lien on, and right of setoff against all Adequate Assurance of Performance in the form of cash transferred by Y to X pursuant to this Section 10.1. Upon the return by X to Y of such Adequate Assurance of Performance, the security interest and lien granted hereunder on that Adequate Assurance of Performance shall be released automatically and, to the extent possible, without any further action by either party.
10.2. In the event (each an "Event of Default") either party (the "Defaulting Party") or its Guarantor shall: (i) make an assignment or any general arrangement for the benefit of creditors; (ii) file a petition or otherwise commence, authorize, or acquiesce in the commencement of a proceeding or case under any bankruptcy or similar law for the protection of creditors or have such petition filed or proceeding commenced against it; (iii) otherwise become bankrupt or insolvent (however evidenced); (iv) be unable to pay its debts as they fall due; (v) have a receiver, provisional liquidator, conservator, custodian, trustee or other similar official appointed with respect to it or substantially all of its assets; (vi) fail to perform any obligation to the other party with respect to any Credit Support Obligations relating to the Contract; (vii) fail to give Adequate Assurance of Performance under Section 10.1 within 48 hours but at least one Business Day of a written request by the other party; (viii) not have paid any amount due the other party hereunder on or before the second Business Day following written Notice that such payment is due; or (x) be the affected party with respect to any Additional Event of Default, then the other party (the "Non-Defaulting Party") shall have the right, at its sole election, to immediately withhold and/or suspend deliveries or payments upon Notice and/or to terminate and liquidate the transactions under the Contract, in the manner provided in Section 10.3, in addition to any and all other remedies available hereunder.
10.3. If an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Non-Defaulting Party shall have the right, by Notice to the Defaulting Party, to designate a Day, no earlier than the Day such Notice is given and no later than 20 Days after such Notice is given, as an early termination date (the "Early Termination Date") for the liquidation and termination pursuant to Section 10.3.1 of all transactions under the Contract, each a "Terminated Transaction". On the Early Termination Date, all transactions will terminate, other than those transactions, if any, that may not be liquidated and terminated under applicable law ("Excluded Transactions"), which Excluded Transactions must be liquidated and terminated as soon thereafter as is legally permissible, and upon termination shall be a Terminated Transaction and be valued consistent with Section 10.3.1 below. With respect to each Excluded Transaction, its actual termination date shall be the Early Termination Date for purposes of Section 10.3.1.

The parties have selected either "Early Termination Damages Apply" or "Early Termination Damages Do Not Apply" as indicated on the Base Contract.

## Early Termination Damages Apply:

10.3.1. As of the Early Termination Date, the Non-Defaulting Party shall determine, in good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner, (i) the amount owed (whether or not then due) by each party with respect to all Gas delivered and received between the parties under Terminated Transactions and Excluded Transactions on and before the Early Termination Date and all other applicable charges relating to such deliveries and receipts (including without limitation any amounts owed under Section 3.2), for which payment has not yet been made by the party that owes such payment under this Contract and (ii) the Market Value, as defined below, of each Terminated Transaction. The Non-Defaulting Party shall (x) liquidate and accelerate each Terminated Transaction at its Market Value, so that each amount equal to the difference between such Market Value and the Contract Value, as defined below, of such Terminated Transaction(s) shall be due to the Buyer under the Terminated Transaction(s) if such Market Value exceeds the Contract Value and to the Seller if the opposite is the case; and (y) where appropriate, discount each amount then due under clause ( $x$ ) above to present value in a commercially reasonable manner as of the Early Termination Date (to take account of the period between the date of liquidation and the date on which such amount would have otherwise been due pursuant to the relevant Terminated Transactions).
For purposes of this Section 10.3.1, "Contract Value" means the amount of Gas remaining to be delivered or purchased under a transaction multiplied by the Contract Price, and "Market Value" means the amount of Gas remaining to be delivered or purchased under a transaction multiplied by the market price for a similar transaction at the Delivery Point determined by the Non-Defaulting Party in a commercially reasonable manner. To ascertain the Market Value, the Non-Defaulting Party may consider, among other valuations, any or all of the settlement prices of NYMEX Gas futures contracts, quotations from leading dealers in energy swap contracts or physical gas trading markets, similar sales or purchases and any other bona fide third-party offers, all adjusted for the length of the term and differences in transportation costs. A party shall not be required to enter into a replacement transaction(s) in order to determine the Market Value. Any extension(s) of the term of a transaction to which parties are not bound as of the Early Termination Date (including but not limited to "evergreen provisions") shall not be considered in determining Contract Values and Market Values. For the avoidance of doubt, any option pursuant to which one party has the right to extend

the term of a transaction shall be considered in determining Contract Values and Market Values. The rate of interest used in calculating net present value shall be determined by the Non-Defaulting Party in a commercially reasonable manner.

# Early Termination Damages Do Not Apply: 

10.3.1. As of the Early Termination Date, the Non-Defaulting Party shall determine, in good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner, the amount owed (whether or not then due) by each party with respect to all Gas delivered and received between the parties under Terminated Transactions and Excluded Transactions on and before the Early Termination Date and all other applicable charges relating to such deliveries and receipts (including without limitation any amounts owed under Section 3.2), for which payment has not yet been made by the party that owes such payment under this Contract.

The parties have selected either "Other Agreement Setoffs Apply" or "Other Agreement Setoffs Do Not Apply" as indicated on the Base Contract.

## Other Agreement Setoffs Apply:

## Bilateral Setoff Option:

10.3.2. The Non-Defaulting Party shall net or aggregate, as appropriate, any and all amounts owing between the parties under Section 10.3.1, so that all such amounts are netted or aggregated to a single liquidated amount payable by one party to the other (the "Net Settlement Amount"). At its sole option and without prior Notice to the Defaulting Party, the Non-Defaulting Party is hereby authorized to setoff any Net Settlement Amount against (i) any margin or other collateral held by a party in connection with any Credit Support Obligation relating to the Contract; and (ii) any amount(s) (including any excess cash margin or excess cash collateral) owed or held by the party that is entitled to the Net Settlement Amount under any other agreement or arrangement between the parties.

## Triangular Setoff Option:

10.3.2. The Non-Defaulting Party shall net or aggregate, as appropriate, any and all amounts owing between the parties under Section 10.3.1, so that all such amounts are netted or aggregated to a single liquidated amount payable by one party to the other (the "Net Settlement Amount"). At its sole option, and without prior Notice to the Defaulting Party, the Non-Defaulting Party is hereby authorized to setoff (i) any Net Settlement Amount against any margin or other collateral held by a party in connection with any Credit Support Obligation relating to the Contract; (ii) any Net Settlement Amount against any amount(s) (including any excess cash margin or excess cash collateral) owed by or to a party under any other agreement or arrangement between the parties; (iii) any Net Settlement Amount owed to the Non-Defaulting Party against any amount(s) (including any excess cash margin or excess cash collateral) owed by the Non-Defaulting Party or its Affiliates to the Defaulting Party under any other agreement or arrangement; (iv) any Net Settlement Amount owed to the Defaulting Party against any amount(s) (including any excess cash margin or excess cash collateral) owed by the Defaulting Party to the Non-Defaulting Party or its Affiliates under any other agreement or arrangement; and/or (v) any Net Settlement Amount owed to the Defaulting Party against any amount(s) (including any excess cash margin or excess cash collateral) owed by the Defaulting Party or its Affiliates to the Non-Defaulting Party under any other agreement or arrangement.

## Other Agreement Setoffs Do Not Apply:

10.3.2. The Non-Defaulting Party shall net or aggregate, as appropriate, any and all amounts owing between the parties under Section 10.3.1, so that all such amounts are netted or aggregated to a single liquidated amount payable by one party to the other (the "Net Settlement Amount"). At its sole option and without prior Notice to the Defaulting Party, the Non-Defaulting Party may setoff any Net Settlement Amount against any margin or other collateral held by a party in connection with any Credit Support Obligation relating to the Contract.
10.3.3. If any obligation that is to be included in any netting, aggregation or setoff pursuant to Section 10.3.2 is unascertained, the Non-Defaulting Party may in good faith estimate that obligation and net, aggregate or setoff, as applicable, in respect of the estimate, subject to the Non-Defaulting Party accounting to the Defaulting Party when the obligation is ascertained. Any amount not then due which is included in any netting, aggregation or setoff pursuant to Section 10.3.2 shall be discounted to net present value in a commercially reasonable manner determined by the Non-Defaulting Party.
10.4. As soon as practicable after a liquidation, Notice shall be given by the Non-Defaulting Party to the Defaulting Party of the Net Settlement Amount, and whether the Net Settlement Amount is due to or due from the Non-Defaulting Party. The Notice shall include a written statement explaining in reasonable detail the calculation of the Net Settlement Amount, provided that failure to give such Notice shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the liquidation or give rise to any claim by the Defaulting Party against the Non-Defaulting Party. The Net Settlement Amount as well as any setoffs applied against such amount pursuant to Section 10.3.2, shall be paid by the close of business on the second Business Day following such Notice, which date shall not be earlier than the Early Termination Date. Interest on any unpaid portion of the Net Settlement Amount as adjusted by setoffs, shall accrue from the date due until the date of payment at a rate equal to the lower of (i) the then-effective prime rate of interest published under "Money Rates" by The Wall Street Journal, plus two percent per annum; or (ii) the maximum applicable lawful interest rate.
10.5. The parties agree that the transactions hereunder constitute a "forward contract" within the meaning of the United States Bankruptcy Code and that Buyer and Seller are each "forward contract merchants" within the meaning of the United States Bankruptcy Code.
10.6. The Non-Defaulting Party's remedies under this Section 10 are the sole and exclusive remedies of the Non-Defaulting Party with respect to the occurrence of any Early Termination Date. Each party reserves to itself all other rights, setoffs, counterclaims and other defenses that it is or may be entitled to arising from the Contract.

10.7. With respect to this Section 10, if the parties have executed a separate netting agreement with close-out netting provisions, the terms and conditions therein shall prevail to the extent inconsistent herewith.

# SECTION 11. FORCE MAJEURE 

11.1. Except with regard to a party's obligation to make payment(s) due under Section 7, Section 10.4, and Imbalance Charges under Section 4, neither party shall be liable to the other for failure to perform a Firm obligation, to the extent such failure was caused by Force Majeure. The term "Force Majeure" as employed herein means any cause not reasonably within the control of the party claiming suspension, as further defined in Section 11.2.
11.2. Force Majeure shall include, but not be limited to, the following: (i) physical events such as acts of God, landslides, lightning, earthquakes, fires, storms or storm warnings, such as hurricanes, which result in evacuation of the affected area, floods, washouts, explosions, breakage or accident or necessity of repairs to machinery or equipment or lines of pipe; (ii) weather related events affecting an entire geographic region, such as low temperatures which cause freezing or failure of wells or lines of pipe; (iii) interruption and/or curtailment of Firm transportation and/or storage by Transporters; (iv) acts of others such as strikes, lockouts or other industrial disturbances, riots, sabotage, insurrections or wars, or acts of terror; and (v) governmental actions such as necessity for compliance with any court order, law, statute, ordinance, regulation, or policy having the effect of law promulgated by a governmental authority having jurisdiction. Seller and Buyer shall make reasonable efforts to avoid the adverse impacts of a Force Majeure and to resolve the event or occurrence once it has occurred in order to resume performance.
11.3. Neither party shall be entitled to the benefit of the provisions of Force Majeure to the extent performance is affected by any or all of the following circumstances: (i) the curtailment of interruptible or secondary Firm transportation unless primary, in-path, Firm transportation is also curtailed; (ii) the party claiming excuse failed to remedy the condition and to resume the performance of such covenants or obligations with reasonable dispatch; or (iii) economic hardship, to include, without limitation, Seller's ability to sell Gas at a higher or more advantageous price than the Contract Price, Buyer's ability to purchase Gas at a lower or more advantageous price than the Contract Price, or a regulatory agency disallowing, in whole or in part, the pass through of costs resulting from this Contract; (iv) the loss of Buyer's market(s) or Buyer's inability to use or resell Gas purchased hereunder, except, in either case, as provided in Section 11.2; or (v) the loss or failure of Seller's gas supply or depletion of reserves, except, in either case, as provided in Section 11.2. The party claiming Force Majeure shall not be excused from its responsibility for Imbalance Charges.
11.4. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the parties agree that the settlement of strikes, lockouts or other industrial disturbances shall be within the sole discretion of the party experiencing such disturbance.
11.5. The party whose performance is prevented by Force Majeure must provide Notice to the other party. Initial Notice may be given orally; however, written Notice with reasonably full particulars of the event or occurrence is required as soon as reasonably possible. Upon providing written Notice of Force Majeure to the other party, the affected party will be relieved of its obligation, from the onset of the Force Majeure event, to make or accept delivery of Gas, as applicable, to the extent and for the duration of Force Majeure, and neither party shall be deemed to have failed in such obligations to the other during such occurrence or event.
11.6. Notwithstanding Sections 11.2 and 11.3, the parties may agree to alternative Force Majeure provisions in a Transaction Confirmation executed in writing by both parties.

## SECTION 12. TERM

This Contract may be terminated on 30 Day's written Notice, but shall remain in effect until the expiration of the latest Delivery Period of any transaction(s). The rights of either party pursuant to Section 7.6, Section 10, Section 13, the obligations to make payment hereunder, and the obligation of either party to indemnify the other, pursuant hereto shall survive the termination of the Base Contract or any transaction.

## SECTION 13. LIMITATIONS

FOR BREACH OF ANY PROVISION FOR WHICH AN EXPRESS REMEDY OR MEASURE OF DAMAGES IS PROVIDED, SUCH EXPRESS REMEDY OR MEASURE OF DAMAGES SHALL BE THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY. A PARTY'S LIABILITY HEREUNDER SHALL BE LIMITED AS SET FORTH IN SUCH PROVISION, AND ALL OTHER REMEDIES OR DAMAGES AT LAW OR IN EQUITY ARE WAIVED. IF NO REMEDY OR MEASURE OF DAMAGES IS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED HEREIN OR IN A TRANSACTION, A PARTY'S LIABILITY SHALL BE LIMITED TO DIRECT ACTUAL DAMAGES ONLY. SUCH DIRECT ACTUAL DAMAGES SHALL BE THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY, AND ALL OTHER REMEDIES OR DAMAGES AT LAW OR IN EQUITY ARE WAIVED. UNLESS EXPRESSLY HEREIN PROVIDED, NEITHER PARTY SHALL BE LIABLE FOR CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY OR INDIRECT DAMAGES, LOST PROFITS OR OTHER BUSINESS INTERRUPTION DAMAGES, BY STATUTE, IN TORT OR CONTRACT, UNDER ANY INDEMNITY PROVISION OR OTHERWISE IT IS THE INTENT OF THE PARTIES THAT THE LIMITATIONS HEREIN IMPOSED ON REMEDIES AND THE MEASURE OF DAMAGES BE WITHOUT REGARD TO THE CAUSE OR CAUSES RELATED THERETO, INCLUDING THE NEGLIGENCE OF ANY PARTY, WHETHER SUCH NEGLIGENCE BE SOLE, JOINT OR CONCURRENT, OR ACTIVE OR PASSIVE. TO THE EXTENT ANY DAMAGES REQUIRED TO BE PAID HEREUNDER ARE LIQUIDATED, THE PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE DAMAGES ARE DIFFICULT OR IMPOSSIBLE TO DETERMINE, OR OTHERWISE OBTANING AN ADEQUATE REMEDY IS INCONVENIENT AND THE DAMAGES CALCULATED HEREUNDER CONSTITUTE A REASONABLE APPROXIMATION OF THE HARM OR LOSS.

# SECTION 14. MARKET DISRUPTION 

If a Market Disruption Event has occurred then the parties shall negotiate in good faith to agree on a replacement price for the Floating Price (or on a method for determining a replacement price for the Floating Price) for the affected Day, and if the parties have not so agreed on or before the second Business Day following the affected Day then the replacement price for the Floating Price shall be determined within the next two following Business Days with each party obtaining, in good faith and from non-affiliated market participants in the relevant market, two quotes for prices of Gas for the affected Day of a similar quality and quantity in the geographical location closest in proximity to the Delivery Point and averaging the four quotes. If either party fails to provide two quotes then the average of the other party's two quotes shall determine the replacement price for the Floating Price. "Floating Price" means the price or a factor of the price agreed to in the transaction as being based upon a specified index. "Market Disruption Event" means, with respect to an index specified for a transaction, any of the following events: (a) the failure of the index to announce or publish information necessary for determining the Floating Price; (b) the failure of trading to commence or the permanent discontinuation or material suspension of trading on the exchange or market acting as the index; (c) the temporary or permanent discontinuance or unavailability of the index; (d) the temporary or permanent closing of any exchange acting as the index; or (e) both parties agree that a material change in the formula for or the method of determining the Floating Price has occurred. For the purposes of the calculation of a replacement price for the Floating Price, all numbers shall be rounded to three decimal places. If the fourth decimal number is five or greater, then the third decimal number shall be increased by one and if the fourth decimal number is less than five, then the third decimal number shall remain unchanged.

## SECTION 15. MISCELLANEOUS

# SPECIAL PROVISIONS TO THE NAESB <br> BASE CONTRACT FOR SALE AND PURCHASE OF NATURAL GAS 

These Special Provisions to the NAESB Base Contract for Sale and Purchase of Natural Gas (these "Special Provisions") are attached to and made a part of that certain Base Contract for Sale and Purchase of Natural Gas between Symmetry Energy Solutions, LLC ("Party A" or "Seller") and Jackson-Madison County General Hospital ("Party B" or "Buyer") dated October 6, 2022 (the "Base Contract").

The parties hereto agree that (i) references to Sections in these Special Provisions refer to a Section of the General Terms and Conditions of the Base Contract; and (ii) these Special Provisions amend the Base Contract as of the date of the Base Contract.

1. Section 1.2 "Oral Transaction Procedure" is amended by adding the phrase "or other electronic means of communication" immediately after the phrase "EDI transmission" in the second sentence, and by deleting the last sentence in the section.
2. Section 2.11 "Contract Quantity" is amended by deleting the section in its entirety and substituting the following in its place:
"Contract Quantity" (and which may also be referred to as the "Volume Commitment") means the quantity of Gas to be delivered and taken as agreed to by the parties in a transaction. If a Transaction Confirmation specifies (i) a fixed price or a first-of-month (FOM) index price as the Contract Price and (ii) the Volume Commitment as 100\% of Buyer's Gas requirements at the Delivery Point(s), then the following provisions will apply: (a) Buyer acknowledges and understands that Seller is utilizing Buyer's Gas History for purposes of determining the Contract Price, Volume Commitment, and Gas services to Buyer's Gas requirements for the Delivery Period; and (b) in the event of any material variance (hereby defined as plus/minus 10\% or greater) between Buyer's actual Gas at the Delivery Point(s) and Buyer's Gas History results in variance charges, incremental Gas purchase or sales, penalties, damages, or other costs and expenses, then such amounts will be reimbursed by, or passed through to, Buyer.
3. Section 2.15 "Delivery Period" is amended by adding the following new sentence at the end of the section:
"If a Transaction Confirmation does not specify that a renewal period applies, but Seller continues to deliver and Buyer continues to receive Gas after the expiration of the initial Delivery Period, then the Transaction will be deemed to automatically continue for a month-to-month renewal period (the "Renewal Period") under the terms of the Transaction Confirmation until terminated by either party upon 30 days' Notice, except that (i) the Contract Price during each month of such Renewal Period will be determined by Seller and (ii) the Contract Quantity during each month of such Renewal Period will be ( $x$ ) the quantity nominated by Buyer (or Seller on behalf of Buyer) or (y) Buyer's historical receipt of Gas at the Delivery Point(s) as determined by Seller ("Buyer's Gas History"). If a Transaction Confirmation is subject to (i) a Renewal Period and (ii) a fixed price with respect to all or part of the Contract Quantity for any month during the Renewal Period, as applicable, then in effect, then the Delivery Period of the Transaction Confirmation will be deemed to have been extended through and including the last calendar month of the Renewal Period in which all or part of the Contract Quantity for any month occurring during such Renewal Period is subject to a fixed price."
4. The following sentence is added at the end of Section 2.19:
"Unless otherwise specified in a Transaction, "Firm" means the utilization of a firm service agreement with a Transporter under which the transaction's Delivery Point is not a specified primary point for the delivery of Gas."
5. Section 2.32 "Transaction Confirmation" is amended by adding the following immediately after the first sentence of the section:

Each Transaction Confirmation will specify, at a minimum, (i) the name of Buyer and Seller, (ii) Buyer's facility or account that is the subject of the Transaction (the "Facility"), (iii) the Contract Price, (iv) any associated fees and charges applicable to the Transaction (collectively, the "Additional Charges"), (v) the Delivery Period (together with any renewal terms), (vi) the Delivery Point(s), (vii) the Contract Quantity, and (viii) whether such deliveries and receipts will be Firm or Interruptible (the "Performance Obligation").
6. The following new Section 2.36 is hereby added, as follows: ""CFTC Regulations" shall mean any applicable rules, regulations, orders, supplementary information, interpretation and guidance issued by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission or any division of office thereof, as amended, modified, superseded, or otherwise

supplemented from time to time."
7. The following new Section 3.5 is added:
"3.5 The parties acknowledge that an operational flow order, curtailment order, critical notice, or other governmental or Transporter directive concerning actual or potential limits or restrictions on the transportation, delivery, receipt, and/or use of Gas to, by, or for Seller, Buyer, or its affiliates (the "RO Gas") or otherwise may occur (a "Restrictive Order") with little to no advance notification. Each party will comply with and take all commercially reasonable actions necessary to mitigate the impact of such Restrictive Order, and any charges or penalties assessed by a governmental authority or Transporter will be borne by the party who failed to mitigate or comply with such Restrictive Order. A Restrictive Order may require or may result in the need for (as reasonably determined by Seller), Seller to sell RO Gas to Buyer at a price subject to then-current market pricing, which may differ from the Contract Price set forth in an affected Transaction, and any such RO Gas will be priced and invoiced to Buyer (including any charges or penalties applicable thereto) as reasonably determined by Seller and paid by Buyer in accordance with Section 7. Seller shall deliver or receive RO Gas on a commercially reasonable basis, including subject to available transportation. For the avoidance of doubt, RO Gas will not be priced at the Contract Price and is not counted towards or subject to the Contract Quantity or Buyer's full requirements of, the affected Transaction. If Buyer fails to comply with a Restrictive Order, Buyer shall be responsible for compensating Seller for Gas, at pricing reasonably determined by Seller, to provide RO Gas or otherwise cover Buyer's receipt or use of Gas. Notwithstanding anything herein, if because of any Restrictive Order Seller is unable to deliver or Buyer is unable to receive all or a portion of RO Gas, then Seller will have no obligation to credit to or repurchase from Buyer any portion of such RO Gas."
8. Section 7.3 is amended by deleting "will be due five Business Days after receipt of invoices." in the last sentence and substituting in its place "will be due ten Business Days after receipt of invoices."
9. Section 7.5 is amended by deleting in clause (i) thereof the words "the then-effective prime rate of interest published under "Money Rates" by The Wall Street Journal, plus two percent per annum" and replacing them with the following: "one and one-half percent ( $11 / 2 \%$ ) of the outstanding balance per month".
10. Section 8.3 is amended by deleting the last sentence in its entirety and substituting the following in its place:
"Buyer, as a governmental entity of the State of Tennessee, and by decision of the State Attorney General, is prohibited from entering into indemnity agreements; such agreements have been determined to nullify state immunity and appropriate public funds without legislative action by the Tennessee General Assembly. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer will be responsible for its own acts or omissions.
11. Section 9.1 is amended by adding the following new sentence at the end of the section:
"Buyer shall advise Seller of any changes or updates to its contact information for Notice purposes. Buyer's failure to provide timely updates to Notice information constitutes a waiver of any challenge to the adequacy of Notice provided by Seller via the contact information identified in this Base Contract."
12. Section 10.1 is deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following:

Buyer must meet Seller's creditworthiness standards at all times. Buyer will provide to Seller, as Seller may reasonably request from time to time, sufficient information to enable Seller to determine Buyer's creditworthiness, including, but not limited to, financial statements and trade references. If Buyer does not at any time meet Seller's creditworthiness standards Seller may require that Buyer provide sufficient credit support for Buyer's payment obligations under this Agreement, in the form and amount, for a term, and from an issuer (as the case may be) reasonably acceptable to Seller ("Adequate Assurance of Performance"). Any Adequate Assurance of Performance subject to an expiry date and which is not renewed or renewable by the issuer must be replaced with other Adequate Assurance of Performance meeting the requirements hereof and provided to Seller prior to the expiration of the expiring Adequate Assurance of Performance. Buyer authorizes Seller to obtain Buyer's Gas usage data and credit history from any Transporter serving Buyer's Facilities and appoints Seller as its agent solely for the purpose of obtaining such usage data and credit history. Each Party agrees that this section supersedes and replaces in their entirety any requirements of law relating to assurance of future performance, including without limitation Article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code.
13. Section 10.2 is amended by deleting subpart (vii) and substituting the following:
"(vii) with respect to Buyer, Buyer fails to give Adequate Assurance of Performance under Section 10.1 on or before the end of the $2^{\text {nd }}$ Business Day following Seller's written request therefor;"

14. Section 10.2 is further amended by deleting the word "or" preceding clause (ix) therein and inserting the following immediately after the semicolon at the end of clause (ix):
"or (x) consolidate or amalgamate with, or merge with or into, or transfer all or substantially all of its assets to, another entity and, at the time of such consolidation, amalgamation, merger or transfer, the resulting, surviving or transferee entity fails to assume all of the obligations of such party under the Contract or the resulting, surviving or transferee entity's credit is materially weaker as determined by the other party acting in good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner;".
15. The following new Section 10.8 is added:
"10.8 The Non-Defaulting Party may recover, and include in its calculation of the Net Settlement Amount, all reasonable costs it incurred as a result of the Terminated Transactions, including but not limited to the following: (i) losses incurred by the Non-Defaulting Party as a result of the Terminated Transactions associated with Transporter costs which cannot be avoided through the Non-Defaulting Party's reasonable efforts; (ii) brokerage fees and commissions and transaction losses, costs and expenses reasonably incurred by the Non-Defaulting Party either in terminating any arrangement pursuant to which it has hedged its obligations or entering into new arrangements which replace a Terminated Transaction; and (iii) commercially reasonable attorneys' fees and court costs, if any, incurred in connection with enforcing its rights in respect of the Terminated Transaction(s) (including collection costs incurred for past due invoices)."
16. Section 11 "Force Majeure" is deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following:
"(a) If either party is prevented or delayed as a result of a Force Majeure Event from performing, in whole or in part, one or more of its obligations under a Transaction and such Party (the "Claiming Party") uses commercially reasonable efforts to give Notice of the Force Majeure Event to the other party or to the other party's representative or agent, then from the date the Force Majeure Event commenced and to the extent and for the duration thereof, the Claiming Party will be excused from the performance of its obligations with respect to such Transaction, and shall not be liable for any delay or failure in performing such obligations, if and to the extent that such failure or delay is a result of such Force Majeure Event (other than the obligation to make payments that are otherwise due and payable under this Agreement), including, without limitation, any obligation to deliver the full Contract Quantity and any obligation to deliver the Contract Quantity or Buyer's full requirements at the Contract Price. The Claiming Party's Notice of such Force Majeure Event may initially provide Notice verbally but will provide written Notice with reasonable detail of the Force Majeure Event as soon as reasonably practicable. The Claiming Party will use commercially reasonable efforts to remedy the failure or delay to perform as a result of the Force Majeure Event; provided, however, (A) Seller is not obligated to deliver, and Buyer is not obligated to receive, Gas under a Transaction at points other than the Delivery Point(s) thereunder; (B) neither party is required to use extraordinary efforts or incur extraordinary costs to avoid or resolve the Force Majeure Event or its impacts; (C) a Force Majeure Event shall not extend the Delivery Period of any Transaction; (D) Seller is not obligated to procure Gas from alternate sources, such as storage; and (E) neither party is obligated to make up any quantity of Gas it would otherwise have been obligated to sell or purchase, as the case may be, during any period in which a Force Majeure Event was validly claimed.
(b) In the event of a Force Majeure Event, Seller has the right to reduce the quantity of Gas it is obligated to deliver and allocate Seller's Gas Supply as Seller determines in its sole discretion across its customers, including Buyer. "Seller's Gas Supply" means Gas acquired by or on behalf of Seller from a third-party supplier or suppliers, whether individually or on an aggregated basis, on a regional, pipeline or geographic basis (as determined solely by Seller in the conduct of its regular business), and from which Seller allocates quantities to be used by Seller to fulfill, in whole or in part, the monthly Contract Quantity (or any daily proration thereof) specified in a Transaction; provided, however, unless otherwise expressly agreed to in a Transaction that also specifically memorializes any agreed upon monetary consideration or fees paid therefor by Buyer to Seller, 'Seller's Gas Supply' excludes Gas in any type of storage, imbalance account or any incremental or balance-of-month Gas purchased by or on behalf of Seller in the daily spot market. A Force Majeure Event may require or may result in the need for (as reasonably determined by Seller), Seller to sell Gas to Buyer ("FM Gas") at a price subject to then-current market pricing, which may differ from the Contract Price set forth in an affected Transaction, and any such FM Gas will be priced and invoiced to Buyer (including any charges or penalties applicable thereto) as reasonably determined by Seller and paid by Buyer in accordance with Section 7. Seller shall deliver or receive FM Gas on a commercially reasonable basis, including subject to available transportation. For the avoidance of doubt, FM Gas will not be priced at the Contract Price of and is not counted towards or subject to the Contract Quantity or Buyer's full requirements of, the affected Transaction. If Buyer receives Gas during a Force Majeure Event, Buyer will be responsible for compensating Seller for

Gas, at pricing reasonably determined by Seller, to provide FM Gas or otherwise cover Buyer's receipt or use of Gas. During a Force Majeure Event, Seller's ability or efforts to source Gas or otherwise cover Buyer's receipt of Gas shall not affect Seller's ability to invoke or the validity of a Force Majeure Event or benefit from the rights set forth in this Section. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if as a result of a Force Majeure Event Seller is unable to deliver or Buyer is unable to receive all or a portion of the applicable Contract Quantity, then Seller will have no obligation to credit to or repurchase from Buyer any portion of such Contract Quantity.
(c)"Force Majeure Event" means an event or circumstance, whether of the kind described herein or otherwise, that prevents or delays the Claiming Party from performing, in whole or in part, one or more of its obligations under a Transaction, which event or circumstance is not within the reasonable control of, does not result from the negligence of, and would not have been avoided or overcome by the exercise of reasonable diligence by, the Claiming Party. Subject to the foregoing sentence, Force Majeure Events include, but are not limited to, the following: (i) physical events such as acts of God, landslides, lightning, earthquakes, fires, storms or storm warnings, such as hurricanes, which result in evacuation of the affected area, floods, washouts, explosions, breakage or accident or necessity of repairs to machinery or equipment or lines of pipe; (ii) weather related events affecting an entire geographic region, such as low temperatures which cause freezing or failure of wells, Gas processing facilities, lines of pipe or appurtenant facilities; (iii) interruption, termination and/or curtailment of Firm transportation (including but not limited to Restrictive Orders, pipeline capacity allocations, unscheduled maintenance, pipeline interconnect issues or other similar problems); (iv) acts of others such as strikes, lockouts or other industrial disturbances, riots, sabotage, insurrections or wars, or acts of terror; and (v) governmental actions such as necessity for compliance with any court order, law, statute, ordinance, or regulation (including but not limited to a tariff regulation in a Transporter's tariff). Unless otherwise specified in a Transaction, the term "Firm" in the preceding sentence means Seller's utilization in its sole discretion of firm service agreement(s) with Transporter(s) under which the Delivery Point(s) is not a specified primary point for the delivery of Gas. Neither party shall be entitled to the provisions of this Section 11 to the extent the party claiming Force Majeure failed to remedy the condition and to resume performance under this Base Contract with reasonable dispatch; provided, however, that the settlement of strikes, lockouts or other industrial disturbances shall be within the sole discretion of the party experiencing such event."
17. Section 14 "Market Disruption" is deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following:
"If a Market Disruption Event has occurred, then either party may give Notice thereof to the other party specifying in reasonable detail the event that has occurred constituting a Market Disruption Event. Upon the giving of such Notice, the parties will negotiate in good faith to agree on a replacement price for the for the Index Price (or on a method for determining a replacement price for the Index Price) for the Affected Period. An "Affected Period" is any part of the Delivery Period under a Transaction affected by the Market Disruption Event. If the parties have not agreed on or before the second Business Day following the date of the Notice of the occurrence of the Market Disruption Event, then the replacement price for the Index Price will be determined within the next two following Business Days with each party obtaining, in good faith and from nonaffiliated market participants in the relevant market, two quotes for prices of natural Gas for the Affected Period of a similar quality and quantity in the geographical location closest in proximity to the Delivery Point(s). Once the parties obtain the quotes, the following methodology shall be used to determine the replacement price for the Index Price: (i) if each party obtains two quotes, the arithmetic mean of the quotations, excluding the highest and lowest values, shall be utilized; (ii) if one party obtains two quotes and the other party only obtains one quote, the highest and lowest values shall be excluded and the remaining quotation shall be utilized; (iii) if both parties each obtain one quote, the arithmetic mean of the quotations shall be utilized; or (iv) if only one party is able to obtain a quote, the obtained quotation should be utilized. For the purposes of the foregoing sentence, if more than one quotation is the same as the other quotation, and such quotations are the highest and/or lowest values, only one of the quotations shall be excluded. "Index Price" means the price or a factor of the price, based on a specified published index, agreed to in a Transaction as the Contract Price. "Market Disruption Event" means, relating to an Index Price in a Transaction, any of the following events: (a) the failure of the index to announce or publish information necessary for determining the Index Price; (b) the failure of trading to commence or the permanent discontinuation or material suspension of trading on the exchange or market acting as the index; (c) the temporary or permanent discontinuance or unavailability of the index; (d) the temporary or permanent closing of any exchange acting as the index; or (e) a market abnormality, anomaly or other occurrence, other than during or caused by a Force Majeure Event, which causes the Index Price to no longer be reflective of the market price of Gas for the relevant market in the geographic area in which the Delivery Point(s) is located."

18. Section 15.5 is amended by adding the following sentence at the end of the section:
"The Parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction for any Dispute or litigation arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be in a Tennessee Circuit Court in Madison County Tennessee or the United States District Court for the Western District of Tennessee in Jackson, Tennessee. The Parties waive any objection to jurisdiction and venue which the Parties otherwise may have to this venue for any such lawsuit."
19. The following new Sections 15.13, 15.14, 15.15, 15.16, 15.17, 15.18, 15.19, and 15.20 are added:
"15.13 If requested, Buyer shall deliver, within one hundred twenty (120) days after the end of each fiscal year and within sixty (60) days after the end of each of its first three fiscal quarters of each fiscal year, a copy of its or its credit support provider's audited financial statements (or certified consolidated unaudited financial statements) prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Nothing in this section will limit Seller's rights to more frequently request financial information from Buyer under Section 10.1.
15.14. Each party shall promptly provide the other party any information reasonably requested by such other party to enable such other party to comply with Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and CFTC Regulations in connection with any transaction between the parties under this Base Contract. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Base Contract or in any non-disclosure, confidentiality or similar agreement between the parties, each party hereby consents to the disclosure of information by the other party to the extent required under CFTC Regulations.
15.15 In addition to any provisions for early termination set forth herein, the parties agree that either party may terminate a relevant transaction if: (i) a Transporter files a tariff change or a court or governmental agency with jurisdiction (including, without limitation, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission) causes a Transporter to initiate a tariff change in a manner that causes a party to incur additional, uncontemplated material capital or operating costs (including, but not limited to, Transporter fixed and/or variable charges or fuel, or in connection with transporter system operational limitations or restrictions) relating to its performance under the transaction; and (ii) the Parties are unable, after good faith negotiations, to renegotiate the transaction."
15.16 Subject to prior credit approval by Seller, Buyer may elect to convert the Contract Price (if it is a floating price) for a portion of the Contract Quantity in a Transaction Confirmation (the "Base Transaction Confirmation") from a floating price to a fixed price (commodity, basis differential, or both). The fixed price (or fixed price component if both commodity and basis differential are not fixed) and the portion of the Contract Quantity subject thereof must be mutually agreed upon by the parties and the terms of any such agreement will be set forth in a separate fixed price Transaction Confirmation (a "Fixed Price Transaction Confirmation"). Unless otherwise specifically provided for in the Fixed Price Transaction Confirmation, all other terms and conditions of the Base Transaction Confirmation including, but not limited to any associated fees and charges applicable to the Transaction (collectively, the "Additional Charges") will continue to apply.
15.17 The parties agree to bring claims only in their individual capacity and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class, consolidated or representative action or proceeding of any kind. Further, unless both Parties agree otherwise in writing, arbitrators may not consolidate more than one party's claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a class, consolidated or representative action or proceeding of any kind. BY AGREEING TO THIS PROVISION, THE PARTIES UNDERSTAND THAT THEY ARE WAIVING ANY RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR CLASS ACTION PROCEEDINGS, INCLUDING AS A CLASS REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS MEMBER."
15.18 Any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to this Base Contract, or the breach, termination, or invalidity hereof, including a dispute of the invoice amount as contemplated by Section 7 (a "Dispute") must be sent in writing to the other party ("Dispute Notice"). The parties shall first attempt in good faith to resolve any Dispute set forth in the Dispute Notice by negotiation and consultation between the parties, including not fewer than two negotiation sessions attended by an authorized representative of each party. Any third-party energy manager or consultant of Buyer will not be deemed to be an authorized representative of Buyer for purposes of this Section unless Buyer expressly specifies such in writing to Seller. In the event the parties are unable to resolve such Dispute within sixty (60) days of the date of the Dispute Notice for whatever reason, either Party may pursue any available legal remedy to enforce its rights pursuant to this Base Contract.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed these Special Provisions, which may be executed in multiple counterparts, but which shall constitute one and the same instrument, effective as of the date first written above.
