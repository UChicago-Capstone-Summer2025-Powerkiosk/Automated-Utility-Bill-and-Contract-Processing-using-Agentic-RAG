## TERMS

## How's my gas measured?

CCF - 100 cubic feet of gas. This is a measure of gas usage. One CCF is about the amount of gas used to run an average-sized house heater nonstop for one hour.

Dekatherms (DTH) - A measure of the heat content value of gas. Gas usage is determined by multiplying the MCF used by the heat content value of the gas.

MCF - 1,000 cubic feet of gas. This is a measure of gas usage.

## Other Helpful Terms

Budget Bill - An optional billing method which averages estimated service costs over a 12-month period.

Meter Reading Information - PGW uses its best effort to obtain an actual meter reading regularly, and at least every six months for customers without automatic meter reading devices. When the meter is not read, PGW estimates your gas use. To avoid estimates, you may read your own meter and call us with the reading. We also offer stamped, preaddressed postcards, which you can use to send us your meter reading by the specified date. To request a supply of these cards, call (215) 235-1000, or write us at P.O. Box 3500, Philadelphia, PA 19122.
