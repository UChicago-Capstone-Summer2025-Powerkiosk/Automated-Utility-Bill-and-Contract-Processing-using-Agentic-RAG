# MASTER ELECTRIC ENERGY SALES AGREEMENT 

This Master Electric Energy Sales Agreement (this "Agreement") is entered into effective as of the 25 day of November 2015 (the "Effective Date") by and between GDF SUEZ ENERGY RESOURCES NA, INC. ("Suez"), a Delaware corporation and ZELLER REALTY ("Customer"). Suez and Customer are also referred to herein individually as a "Party" and collectively as the "Parties." Unless provided to the contrary, capitalized terms are defined in Section 3.

## SECTION 1. TRANSACTION TERMS AND CONDITIONS

1.1 Purchase and Sale Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, Suez shall sell and deliver and Customer shall purchase and receive Firm Full Requirements Service pursuant to a Sales Confirmation attached hereto and the terms and conditions specified herein. Any conflict between the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the terms and conditions in an applicable Sales Confirmation shall be resolved in favor of the Sales Confirmation. During the term of this Agreement, should Suez fail to deliver sufficient quantities of electricity to the local utility distribution company for delivery to Customer or fail to schedule the delivery of electricity to Customer by the local utility distribution company, Customer and Suez recognize: (i) the local utility distribution company, per the local utility distribution company's Tariff responsibilities, nevertheless is obligated to deliver sufficient electricity to satisfy Customer's needs and (ii) Suez shall settle with the ISO subject to Section 1.4 herein at no additional cost or expense to Customer with respect to the purchase of electricity to cover any such failure.
1.2 Contract Price Customer shall pay Suez the Contract Price, as specified in an applicable Sales Confirmation, for the quantity of electric energy consumed in a Billing Cycle.
1.3 Term. This Agreement shall be effective on the Effective Date and shall remain in effect until terminated by either Party upon thirty (30) days prior written notice. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the termination of this Agreement shall not affect or excuse the performance of either Party pursuant to any provision of this Agreement that by its terms survives any such termination and provided, further, any Sales Confirmations executed pursuant to this Agreement shall remain in effect, and the provisions of this Agreement shall continue to apply thereto, until both Parties have fulfilled any and all of their respective obligations with respect to the underlying transactions.
1.4 Billing and Payment As soon as practicable following the receipt of any invoice detailing Utility Related Charges, ISO fees or charges, and Customer's metered electric energy consumption, Suez will deliver to Customer an invoice setting forth the amount due for the preceding Billing Cycle. Such invoice shall include the monthly charges for energy consumption and any other charges or fees imposed pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, and any applicable Taxes and Utility Related Charges. Suez may, however, use estimated data for billing purposes hereunder provided that such estimates will be subject to future reconciliation upon receipt of final data regarding the actual quantity of energy consumed for the applicable Billing Cycle. As measured from the date of the invoice, payment shall be due to Suez by check, electronic transfer or any other mutually agreed upon payment method in accordance with the payment terms of the Sales Confirmation. Overdue payments will accrue interest at the Interest Rate from the due date to the date of payment. If any amount of an invoice is disputed in good faith, the entire amount shall be paid when due. Any disputed amounts that are ultimately determined to be owed to Customer shall be re-paid by Suez with interest accrued at the Interest Rate from the date payment was due through the date of re-payment to the Customer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Suez elects to utilize the applicable local utility to distribute invoices, Customer shall comply with the billing and payment requirements of the local utility.

## SECTION 2. GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS

2.1 Notices. Notices, correspondence, and address changes shall be in writing and delivered by regular or electronic mail, facsimile, or similar means or in person. Notice by facsimile, electronic mail or hand delivery shall be deemed to have been received on the date transmitted or delivered (after business hours deemed received on next Business Day) and notice by overnight mail or courier is deemed received two (2) Business Days after it was sent. All notices shall be provided to the person and addresses specified in Section 4, or to such other person and address as a Party may from time to time specify in writing to the other Party.
2.2 Taxes. "Tax(es)" means all fees and taxes (other than income taxes) imposed by a governmental authority on the purchase and sale of electricity, including utility, gross receipts, sales, use, franchise and excise taxes. Customer is responsible for all Taxes and shall reimburse Suez for the cost of any such Tax without markup, whether levied directly on Customer or Suez. Customer will provide any applicable Tax exemption certificates, and until provided, no exemption will apply. Customer and Suez will administer and implement this Agreement with the intent to minimize Taxes. Suez will not refund or credit previously paid Taxes, but will assign to Customer applicable refund claims.
2.3 Title, Risk of Loss. Title, liability and risk of loss associated with the electric energy purchased and sold hereunder shall pass from Suez to Customer at the delivery point specified in an applicable Sales Confirmation.
2.4 Credit Assurances. If requested by a Party, the other Party or its Guarantor shall make available within a reasonable period of time copies of all its SEC Form 10-K and/or Form 10-Q reports or, if such reports are unavailable, copies of the Party's most recent audited financial statements. Such reports shall be prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; provided, however, that should any such statements not be available on a timely basis due to a delay in preparation or certification, such delay shall not be an Event of Default so long as such Party or such Guarantor diligently pursues the

preparation, certification and delivery of the specified reports. If either Party has reasonable grounds to believe the other Party has experienced a Material Adverse Change or the other Party's creditworthiness or performance under this Agreement has become unsatisfactory, then that Party shall provide the other Party with written notice requesting Performance Assurance in an amount determined by the requesting Party in a commercially reasonable manner. Upon receipt of such notice, the receiving Party shall have three (3) Business Days to remedy the situation by providing such Performance Assurance to the requesting Party. In the event that the receiving Party fails to provide such Performance Assurance within three (3) Business Days of receipt of such notice, then an Event of Default shall be deemed to have occurred and the requesting Party shall be entitled to any remedies set forth in this Agreement.
2.5 Force Majeure. "Force Majeure" shall mean an event that is beyond the reasonable control of the Claiming Party that could not have been prevented by the exercise of due diligence, including, but not limited to: acts of God, civil disturbances or disobedience; labor dispute, labor shortage; sabotage; explosions; accidents affecting machinery or power lines; lightning; earthquakes; fires; storms; tornadoes, floods, failure of transmission or distribution, failure of generation, acts of a public enemy; and the direct or indirect effect of governmental orders, actions or interferences (so long as the Claiming Party has not applied for, assisted in, or failed to reasonably oppose such government action). Nothing contained herein shall be construed to require a Claiming Party to settle any strike or labor dispute. If either Party is rendered unable by Force Majeure to carry out, in whole or part, its obligations under this Agreement, such Party shall give notice and provide full details of the event to the other Party in writing as soon as practicable after the occurrence of the event. During such Force Majeure period, the obligations of the Parties (other than the obligation to make payments then due or becoming due with respect to performance prior to the event) will be suspended to the extent required. The Party claiming Force Majeure will make all reasonable attempts to remedy the effects of the Force Majeure and continue performance under this Agreement with all reasonable dispatch; provided, however, that no provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted to require Suez to deliver, or Customer to receive, electric energy at points other than the delivery point(s). Force Majeure shall not include (a) Customer's decision to shut down, sell or relocate its facilities or (b) economic loss due to Customer's loss of markets or suppliers.
2.6 Events of Default. An "Event of Default" means, with respect to a Party alleged to have taken or been affected by any of the actions set forth below in this section (the "Defaulting Party"): (a) the failure by the Defaulting Party to make, when due, any payment required under this Agreement if such failure is not remedied within five (5) Business Days after written notice of such failure is given to the Defaulting Party by the other Party ("Non-Defaulting Party"), or (b) any representation or warranty made by the Defaulting Party in this Agreement proves to have been false or misleading in any material respect when made or ceases to remain true during the Term; or (c) the failure by the Defaulting Party to perform any covenant set forth in this Agreement and for which a remedy is not provided herein and such failure is not excused by the other Party in writing or by Force Majeure or cured within five (5) Business Days after written notice thereof to the Defaulting Party; or (d) the failure of a Party to provide Performance Assurance in accordance with Section 2.4; or (e) absent agreement to the contrary the failure of Customer to utilize Suez as its sole supplier of electric energy for the facilities and accounts specified in an applicable Sales Confirmation (absent a failure to perform by Suez); or (f) the Defaulting Party: (i) makes an assignment or any general arrangement for the benefit of creditors; or (ii) otherwise becomes Bankrupt or Insolvent.
2.7 Remedies upon Event of Default. If an Event of Default occurs, the Non-Defaulting Party shall have the right (i) to liquidate and terminate any and all Sales Confirmations hereunder and/or (ii) suspend performance. If Non-Defaulting Party elects to terminate and liquidate, it shall calculate the aggregate amount of losses or gains it incurs in accordance with the following formula: Termination Payment $=$ (Contract Price - Current Market Price) $\times$ (the amount of electricity remaining to be delivered under the terminated Sales Confirmations as shown in the Monthly Anticipated Consumption table attached thereto). The Non-Defaulting Party shall provide a written explanation of its calculation of the Termination Payment to the Defaulting Party, and the Termination Payment shall be due within five (5) Business Days thereafter.
2.8 Limitation of Liability. FOR BREACH OF ANY PROVISION FOR WHICH AN EXPRESS REMEDY OR MEASURE OF DAMAGES IS PROVIDED IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE LIABILITY OF THE DEFAULTING PARTY SHALL BE LIMITED AS SET FORTH IN SUCH PROVISION, AND ALL OTHER DAMAGES OR REMEDIES HEREBY ARE WAIVED. IF NO REMEDY OR MEASURE OF DAMAGES IS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED, THE LIABILITY OF THE DEFAULTING PARTY SHALL BE LIMITED TO DIRECT ACTUAL DAMAGES ONLY AND ALL OTHER DAMAGES AND REMEDIES ARE WAIVED. IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER PARTY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY OR INDIRECT DAMAGES IN TORT, CONTRACT UNDER ANY INDEMNITY PROVISION OR OTHERWISE.
2.9 Indemnification. Except as limited by Section 2.8, each Party shall indemnify, defend and hold the other Party harmless from claims, demands and causes of action asserted against the indemnitee by any person arising from or out of any event, circumstance, act or incident first occurring or existing during the period when control and title to electric energy is vested in such Party as provided in Section 2.3.

Customer further represents and warrants to Suez throughout the term of this Agreement that no facility or account listed on Attachment A, Exhibit 1 is classified by the applicable utility as a residential account. With the exception of any warranty that is expressly set forth in this Agreement, Suez and its successors, assigns and delegatees make NO WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE with regard to the services Suez provides or the activities Customer undertakes, pursuant to this Agreement. Suez has no duty to advise Customer or exercise judgment on Customer's behalf as to the merits or suitability of any transactions that Suez proposes to enter into with Customer.
2.11Confidentiality. Neither Party shall disclose, unless authorized in writing by the other Party, the terms of this Agreement to a third party (other than the Party's employees or its lenders, counselors or accountants who have agreed to keep such terms confidential) except in order to comply with any applicable law, order, regulation or exchange rule, to collect debts owed or to obtain transmission, distribution, ancillary or other regulated services; provided, each Party will notify the other Party of any proceeding of which it is aware which may result in non-routine disclosure. The Parties shall be entitled to all remedies available at law or in equity to enforce, or seek relief in connection with, this confidentiality obligation; provided, all monetary damages shall be limited to direct actual damages and a breach of this section shall not give rise to a right to suspend or terminate this Agreement.
2.12Modification of Agreement. Any alteration, deletion or addition to this Agreement shall be effective only if made in a written amendment executed by both Parties. No amendment, modification or supplement shall be made to this Agreement by course of performance, course of dealing or usage of trade, or by the failure of a Party to object to a deviation from the terms of this Agreement.
2.13Assignment and Binding Effect. Neither Party will assign this Agreement or any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other Party. Consent to assignment shall not be unreasonably withheld. Any successor or assignee of the rights of any Party shall be subject to all the provisions and conditions of this Agreement to the same extent as though such successor or assignee were the original Party under this Agreement. The assignment or transfer of any rights under this Agreement shall be effective when the assignee or transferee agrees in writing to assume all of the obligations of the assignor or transferor and to be bound by all of the provisions and conditions of this Agreement. This Agreement will inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns. Any assignment in violation of this Section shall be void.
2.14Billing Dispute Resolution. A Party may, in good faith, dispute the correctness of any invoice or any adjustment to an invoice rendered under this Agreement or adjust any arithmetic or computational error within twenty-four (24) months of the date the invoice or adjustment to an invoice was rendered. In the event of any dispute between the Parties about any bill, charge or service pursuant to this Agreement, each Party will thoroughly investigate the matter and promptly report the results of its investigation to the other Party. Any dispute with respect to an invoice is waived unless the other Party is notified in accordance with this Section 2.14 within twenty-four (24) months after the invoice is rendered or any specific adjustment to the invoice is made.
2.15Change in Law. In the event that there is a change in law, administrative regulation, tariff, or any fees or costs imposed by the applicable ISO or by a Governmental Authority, or a change in ISO/RTO Operations, market structure, congestion zone design, or protocols, or a change in application or interpretation thereof, and such change causes Suez to incur any capital, operating or other costs relating to the provision of services contemplated herein, in order to maintain the same level and quantity of delivery of electric energy, Suez shall have the right to adjust the amounts payable by Customer under this Agreement to reflect, based on the type of change, Customer's pro rata share of Suez's incremental costs resulting from such change. Provided that, in the event such a change in law renders performance under this Agreement illegal, the Parties shall meet as soon as practicable to attempt to renegotiate this Agreement to comply with such change, and if the Parties are unable to amend this Agreement, the Parties' obligations hereunder shall terminate upon the earlier of the date the change in law becomes effective or on the date Customer commences service with a retail energy provider in lieu of Suez.
2.16Governing Law. THIS AGREEMENT AND ALL MATTERS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO IT SHALL BE GOVERNED AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF TEXAS, WITHOUT REGARD TO ANY CONFLICTS-OF-LAW PRINCIPLE THAT DIRECTS THE APPLICATION OF ANOTHER JURISDICTION'S LAWS. EACH PARTY CONSENTS TO THE PERSONAL JURISDICTION IN ANY FEDERAL OR STATE COURT WITHIN HOUSTON, HARRIS COUNTY, TEXAS IN ANY ACTION OR SUIT COMMENCED IN SUCH COURT, AND EACH PARTY HEREBY WAIVES ANY OBJECTION THAT IT MAY HAVE BASED UPON LACK OF PERSONAL JURISDICTION, IMPROPER VENUE OR FORUM NON CONVENIENS. EACH PARTY WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT.

There are no prior or contemporaneous agreements or representations affecting the same subject matter other than those herein expressed. No amendment, modification or change will be enforceable unless reduced to writing and executed by both Parties. No waiver by any Party hereto of any one or more defaults by the other Party in the performance of any of the provisions of this Agreement will be construed as a waiver of any other default or defaults whether of a like kind or different nature. If any provision of this Agreement is found to be illegal or unenforceable, the other provisions shall remain effective and enforceable to the greatest extent permitted by law. All confidentiality and indemnity rights will survive the termination of this Agreement. This Agreement may be executed in several counterparts, each of which will be an original and all of which constitute one and the same instrument. Except as expressly provided otherwise in this Agreement, all remedies in this Agreement, including the right of termination, are cumulative, and use of any remedy shall not preclude any other remedy in this Agreement.

# SALES CONFIRMATION Illinois <br> Fixed Price RTC 

This Sales Confirmation is entered on 11/25/2015 ("Confirmation Effective Date"), by and between GDF SUEZ Energy Resources NA, Inc. ("Suez") and Zeller Realty ("Customer") (hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Parties") regarding the purchase and sale of electric energy and related services pursuant to and subject to the Master Electric Energy Sales Agreement dated 11/25/15 by and between the Parties (the "Master Agreement"). Terms not defined herein shall have the meaning given in the Master Agreement.

Transaction Term: This Sales Confirmation shall be effective on the Confirmation Effective Date and the service contemplated herein shall commence at the Contract Price on the Utility Transfer Date immediately on or following the Start Date as specified for each facility in Attachment A, Exhibit 1. Service shall remain in effect at the Contract Price through the Utility Transfer Date immediately on or following the End Date as specified for each facility in Attachment A, Exhibit 1, but in no event later than the end of the Billing Cycle including such date, unless earlier terminated pursuant to the default provisions of the Master Agreement. Such termination shall not affect or excuse performance under any provision surviving such termination. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Customer's options for service beyond the Utility Transfer Date immediately following the End Date (the "Post-Term Period") include: i) executing an agreement with Suez for new terms and conditions of service, ii) transferring the accounts to another competitive supplier or iii) providing a written request to Suez to transfer Customer's accounts to the applicable default service provider. In the event Customer does not timely exercise one of the options above, service by Suez may continue hereunder after the Utility Transfer Date following the End Date until the next available Utility Transfer Date on or following Customer's exercise of one of the above options or Suez's transfer of the accounts to the applicable default service provider, whichever occurs first. For service during the Post-Term Period, in lieu of the Contract Price described in this Sales Confirmation, Customer shall pay Suez an amount equal to the applicable real time index price as posted by the ISO for the relevant delivery point, plus a per kWh Post-Term Charge as defined herein, plus any applicable non-utility charges, including but not limited to ancillary services, installed (or unforced) capacity, network integrated transmission, losses, and all other ISO charges or administrative fees incurred in connection with delivery of energy to the delivery point specified in Attachment A, Exhibit 1. Taxes and Utility Related Charges are additional and not included and are separately listed in the Customer invoice.

Full Swing Transaction: Customer's electricity consumption is variable and is not subject to a maximum or minimum usage limit.

Contract Price: Customer shall pay Suez the applicable Contract Price as specified in Attachment A, Exhibit 1 per kWh of electric energy consumed in a Billing Cycle.

Except to the extent that a charge is separately listed as an obligation in this Sales Confirmation (e.g. Capacity, Congestion), this Contract Price may include, if applicable, an Intermediary Fee, and includes all non-utility charges including energy, ancillary services, installed (or unforced) capacity, congestion, losses (including distribution and transmission losses (if applicable) incurred in connection with the delivery of energy to the meter at the Facilities/Accounts identified in Attachment A), network integrated transmission (adjusted for tariff changes), and other ISO charges or administrative fees incurred in connection with delivery of energy to the delivery point specified in Attachment A, Exhibit 1.

The Contract Price does not include RPS Compliance Fees.
Regulatory Charges: The Contract Price does not include Regulatory Charges.
Taxes and Utility Related Charges: Taxes and Utility Related Charges are separately listed in the Customer bill and are not included in any other charge identified in this Sales Confirmation.

Facilities, Accounts and Quantities: See Attachment A.
Miscellaneous:

Payment Terms: Twenty (20) days.
IDR Meter Authorization: Customer shall, during the term of this Sales Confirmation, promptly provide all necessary authorizations to Suez in order to allow Suez to receive interval meter data (IDR) from Customer's facility(ies) listed on Attachment A.

ON-SITE CUSTOMER GENERATION: The Contract Price is conditioned on Customer's representation that, except for emergency back-up generation used when the local utility is not capable of delivering electricity, Customer does not operate on-site generation or thermal storage facilities. If Customer does operate on-site generation or thermal storage, Suez shall calculate in a commercially reasonable manner the present value of any economic loss resulting from the reduced load caused by such operation, and such loss shall be due from the Customer.

Government/Public Entity Payment Terms and Indemnity Waiver. This Agreement may be subject to state mandated payment term requirements for government/public entities; Customer shall provide a written verification of the applicability of such provision(s) to Suez to receive such extended terms at an additional cost to be determined by Suez. To the extent prohibited by state law or other statute, the Indemnification provision set forth in Section 2.9 of the Master Agreement shall be inapplicable.

Independent System Operator (ISO) means the system operator that controls or governs the transmission and distribution system or any successor thereto for the location where the facility(ies) are physically located.
"Utility Related Charges" means tariff based charges or surcharges assessed by a local utility arising from or related to, including but not limited to, (i) transmission and distribution of energy (other than network integrated transmission service); (ii) stranded costs or transition costs and any other similar types of charges associated with the opening of the applicable state's electric market to competition; (iii) system reliability, rate recovery, future payback of under-collections, amortization, of above market purchases or energy load repurchases, public purpose programs and all similar items.
"Intermediary Fee" means a fee included in the Contract Price that Customer agrees should be remitted to the energy broker/service provider Customer engaged, if any, in the selection of Suez as its electricity supplier.
"Regulatory Charges" means Real-time Reliability Must Run charges assigned to Customer by Suez in its commercially reasonable discretion.
"Post-Term Charge" means the $\$ / \mathrm{kWh}$ charge of electric energy consumed as specified on the Attachment A. Suez may, at its discretion, charge an additional fee of up to $\$ 0.0030 / \mathrm{kWh}$ of electric energy consumed if the number of accounts specified on the Attachment A exceeds 100.

Facility/Account Deletions Prior to End Date: The Parties intend that each of the Facilities listed on Attachment A will be continuously served by Suez through the End Date shown on Attachment A. However, should Customer close a Facility or otherwise discontinue electric service prior to the End Date, then Suez shall calculate in a commercially reasonable manner, the present value of any economic gain or loss it incurred thereby. Any gain or loss that Suez reasonably concludes is material shall be due to Customer (if a gain) or due from Customer (if a loss). Customer shall provide notice of any Facility closure to Suez as soon as practicable.
"RPS Compliance Fees" means an allocation to Customer of its share of costs incurred by Suez to comply with the Renewable Portfolio Standards imposed by applicable State regulatory authority or ISO at any time during the term of this Agreement.

Billing Contact Information: All invoices to Customer for service under this Sales Confirmation shall be provided to the person and address specified in the chart following the signature block of this Sales Confirmation.
