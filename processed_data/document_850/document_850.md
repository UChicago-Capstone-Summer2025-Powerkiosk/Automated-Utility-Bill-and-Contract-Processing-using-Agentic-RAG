- POWERLINE SAFETY: Water and electricity don't mix - that's why it's important to be aware of your surroundings and watch out for electrical hazards when working or playing around water recreation areas. Look for overhead power lines before performing activities such as casting a fishing line, using a pool skimming tool or raising a boat mast, and NEVER swim around docks with electrical equipment or boats plugged into shore power. Always keep yourself or any conductive material a minimum of 10 feet away from any power line. Call 1-800-Edison-1 before working near power lines. Learn more at ComEd.com/Safety.
- THE SUPPORT TO STOP A SCAM: The ability to send money through mobile-pay apps linked to your personal bank account or credit card like QuickPay, Zelle and Venmo make it easier to fall for scam attempts. Scammers claim they didn't see the transaction and ask it to be sent again - scamming you twice. Take steps to protect yourself from energy fraud. We can help with tips and hints to recognize potential scams and legitimate ComEd employees. Learn more: ComEd.Com/ScamAlert
