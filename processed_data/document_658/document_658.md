In addition to the price per therm for natural gas, I will also be charged a per therm Interstate Transportation/Storage Charge that will be determined by Constellation and may vary throughout the term of this Contract.
4. I understand that my sales representative is an independent agent of Constellation and does not represent NIPSCO.

10. I have the right to return to NIPSCO service in the event Constellation terminates my service.
11. I will continue to be supplied with natural gas for my business whether or not I sign this Contract. If I choose to remain with NIPSCO, the price will continue to be set subject to regulatory tariff provisions.
12. This Commercial Customer Acknowledgement Form, Commercial Natural Gas Supplier Enrollment Form, any welcome letter and the Terms and Conditions attached hereto are my complete agreement with Constellation (collectively referred to herein as this "Contract"), and the agent has no authority to change or add to this Contract.
13. Constellation is a registered supplier under the NIPSCO Choice Program (the "Choice Program"), which is subject to ongoing jurisdiction of the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission ("IURC"). The IURC does not regulate the price of gas or other charges found in this Contract.

1. I want Constellation NewEnergy - Gas Division, LLC ("Constellation") to supply all the natural gas I need to heat my business and for other related uses. I am eighteen (18) years of age or older, and I am fully authorized to enter into this Contract (as hereinafter defined). I represent and warrant that the natural gas purchased under this Contract will not be used for personal, family or household use. The Commercial Customer Acknowledgement Form, Commercial Natural Gas Supplier Enrollment Form, any welcome letter and these Terms and Conditions are my complete agreement with Constellation (collectively referred to herein as this "Contract").
2. I understand that:

- I can continue to have natural gas supplied by my current utility, Northern Indiana Public Service Company ("NIPSCO").
- NIPSCO will continue to deliver gas to me, read my meter, and also provide emergency and other services they have provided in the past.
- The natural gas I buy from Constellation may be included in my NIPSCO monthly bill.
- This Contract is subject to eligibility requirements of NIPSCO, and Constellation may choose not to accept this Contract for any reason.

3. My supply will begin on the date set by NIPSCO after my enrollment and shall continue for the number of monthly billing cycles indicated above (the "Primary Term"). It may take up to two billing cycles for service to begin. Constellation is not responsible for any delays in enrollment.
4. Each month my bill will be calculated by multiplying (i) the rate of gas charged per therm as indicated in this Contract by (ii) the amount of gas used in the billing cycle plus (iii) applicable taxes, fees, and charges for transportation (including the per therm Interstate Transportation/Storage Charge), distribution and other services. This price may be higher or lower than NIPSCO's price in any given month. If set forth in this Contract, a customer administration charge will be added to the monthly bill.
5. If Constellation decides to renew this Contract, then no later than forty-five (45) days prior to the end of the Primary Term, Constellation will send me a notice of the conditions that will apply for the renewal period. Unless I terminate this Contract in writing at least thirty (30) days before the end of the Primary Term, this Contract will automatically renew in accordance with the renewal terms and conditions. If the renewal notice indicates that this Contract will be renewed at a Monthly Variable Price, the Monthly Variable Price will be set in Constellation's discretion and may vary from month to month based on Constellation's assessment of applicable market conditions, historic and projected supply and hedging costs,

prior months pricing and balancing costs, projected average customer bill amounts and utility pricing. My Monthly Variable Price may include the following additional costs: balancing costs, transportation costs, line loss costs, storage costs, pooling charges, credit costs and a profit margin determined in Constellation's discretion that may vary from month to month.
6. This Contract may be cancelled as follows:

- Within five (5) business days from the date I signed or received this Contract, I may cancel this Contract by contacting Constellation at (855) 465-1244 or by written request.
- If I terminate this Contract after the fifth $\left(5^{\text {th }}\right)$ business day from the date I signed or received this Contract, the early termination fee will be the greater of $\$ 150$ or the amount of gas I failed to consume during the remainder of my fixed term, calculated on the basis of prior usage, multiplied by the positive difference, if any, between the fixed price I agreed to pay and the price for which Constellation can sell such gas at the time of my termination.
- The early termination fee is not a penalty, but compensates Constellation for the cost of buying gas in advance on my behalf. The fee only applies to fixed price contracts.
- This Contract will automatically terminate without penalty if I move and the requested service location is not served by NIPSCO, or if I move to an area not served by Constellation; otherwise, this Contract will remain in effect if I move.
- This Contract will terminate in the event I am disconnected from service for non-payment. Re-enrollment will be required to re-establish my eligibility and service under the Choice Program under a new agreement.
- If I receive an arrears notice and do not pay the arrearage balance prior to my next cycle billing date, then effective as of that next billing date, I will be removed from the Choice Program and returned to bundled utility service.
- All returned checks will be subject to the maximum fee allowed by law.
- In the future Constellation may bill me directly and separately from NIPSCO.
- If I fail to pay my bill, Constellation may cancel this Contract by providing me with fifteen (15) days written notice.
- If the IURC or NIPSCO decides to end or change the program under which I buy gas, Constellation may cancel this Contract on 30 days advance written notice with no penalty. In the event Constellation is no longer eligible to participate in the Choice Program, this Contract shall automatically terminate with no penalty.
- If I fail to pay my bill in a timely manner NIPSCO may terminate my eligibility for the Choice Program.
- Should I fail to comply with NIPSCO's payment policies I may no longer be eligible for the Choice Program and will be subject to any pertinent late fees as set forth in the NIPSCO tariff approved by the IURC.
It may take up to two billing cycles to switch service back to NIPSCO or another supplier in the event of the cancellation or termination of this Contract. I am responsible for paying all natural gas consumed prior to the time the switch to NIPSCO or another supplier is effective.

- If my questions are not resolved after I have called Constellation, I may also call the Indiana Office of Utility Consumer Counselor ("OUCC"). The OUCC is the state agency with the statutory responsibility of representing consumers on all utility matters. I have a right to contact this agency with any questions, concerns or conflicts, regarding Constellation or the program. Contact Information: Indiana Office of Utility Consumer Counselor, PNC Center, 115 W. Washington St., Suite 1500 South, Indianapolis, Indiana 46204; www.IN.gov/OUCC; Toll Free: (888) 441-2494, Voice/TDD: (317) 232-2494, FAX: (317) 232-5923. Email: UCCINFO@oucc.in.gov.

8. IF I SMELL GAS I SHOULD IMMEDIATELY CALL NIPSCO AT (800) 634-3524 AND LOCAL EMERGENCY PERSONNEL AT 911.
9. Throughout the Primary Term and any renewal terms, I authorize Constellation to obtain information from NIPSCO that includes, but is not limited to, account name, account number, credit information, billing address, service address, telephone number, standard offer service type, historical and future natural gas usage (including for the last 0,12 or 36 months), rate classification, meter readings, characteristics of natural gas service and, when charges hereunder are included on my NIPSCO bill, billing and payment information from NIPSCO. I authorize Constellation to release such information to third parties that need to know such information in connection with my natural gas supply service and to Constellation's affiliates and subcontractors. These authorizations shall remain in effect as long as this Contract is in effect. I may rescind these authorizations at any time by either calling or providing written notice to Constellation. Constellation reserves the right to reject my enrollment or terminate this Contract in the event these authorizations are rescinded, I fail to meet or maintain satisfactory credit standing as determined by Constellation, or I fail to meet minimum or maximum threshold consumption levels as determined by Constellation. If I fail to remit payment in a timely fashion, Constellation may report the delinquency to a credit-reporting agency.
10. Constellation will deliver natural gas to an existing or future point of interconnection between NIPSCO's distribution system and a third party pipeline supplying natural gas to NIPSCO (the "Delivery Point"). Title and risk of loss related to natural gas transfer to me at the Delivery Point and I will be responsible for the all transmission, distribution and other costs (including Taxes, fuel and distribution/line loss, and other costs and fees) related to the sale purchase, and delivery of such natural gas to my home or business. "Taxes" means all taxes, assessments, duties, fees, levies premiums or any other charges of any kind, whether direct or indirect, and whether imposed on me or that Constellation passes through to me, relating to the sale, purchase or delivery of natural gas, together with all interest, penalties or other additional amounts imposed, including but

not limited to gross receipts, utility taxes, sales, consumption, use, value added, per therm, commercial activity or other privilege tax, and any other tax (whether in effect as of the effective date of this agreement) imposed by any governmental entity.
11. I agree that neither Constellation nor any of its affiliates or subcontractors shall be liable for any damages or claims for matters within the control of NIPSCO, which include maintenance of pipelines, service interruptions, loss or termination of service, meter readings or injury to persons or damage to property caused by the delivery or supply of natural gas. Neither Constellation nor any of its affiliates or subcontractors will be responsible for any failure to commence or terminate natural gas supply service on the date specified herein due to any failure or delay in enrolling you with NIPSCO. Constellation's liability shall be limited to direct actual damages only, which will not exceed the amount of my single largest monthly invoice during the preceding twelve (12) months. In no event shall Constellation or any of its affiliates or subcontractors be liable for any punitive, incidental, consequential, exemplary, indirect, third-party claims or other damages whether based on contract, warranty, tort, negligence, strict liability or otherwise, or for lost profits arising from any breach or nonperformance of this Contract. If something happens that is beyond Constellation's reasonable control that prevents us from performing our obligations under this Contract, then Constellation will be relieved from performance until the situation is resolved. Examples of such events include: acts of God, fire, flood, hurricane, war, terrorism; labor disputes; declaration of emergency by a governmental entity or NIPSCO; curtailment, disruption or interruption of natural gas distribution or supply; regulatory, administrative, or legislative action, or action or restraint by court order or other governmental entity; and actions taken by third parties not under my or Constellation's control, such as NIPSCO.
12. I understand that there may be delays before NIPSCO switches my account and that Constellation may choose not to accept this Contract for any reason whatsoever. This Contract is our complete agreement. No oral statements made by anyone are a part of this Contract, and any changes to this Contract must be made in writing. Constellation may change the terms of this Contract by providing notice of such change at least thirty (30) days prior to the effective date of the change. If I do not agree with the change, I may cancel this Contract by providing written notice to Constellation within thirty (30) days of the date of the notice. Constellation may record and disclose telephone conversations with me. Constellation may ask commercial customers for credit enhancements or adequate assurance of their ability to perform their obligations under this Contract, which must be provided within thirty (30) days of such request. Constellation may assign this Contract to another supplier authorized by NIPSCO provided that Constellation gives me no less than thirty (30) days written notice and the assignee assumes all of Constellation's responsibilities and duties under this contract. Any required notice shall be deemed to have been made if mailed to the appropriate party at the last known mailing address. Neither my Customer account number(s) nor any other confidential information will be released without my written consent. For purposes of accounting both parties accept the quantity, quality, and measurement determined by NIPSCO. Except as provided by law, all taxes due and payable with respect to the customers obligations under this Contract shall be paid by customer.
13. Constellation may pass through or allocate, as the case may be, to you any increase in Constellation's costs related to the natural gas and related products and services to be sold to you that results from the implementation of new, or changes (including changes to pipeline or Utility transportation rates) to existing, Laws, or other requirements or changes in administration or interpretation of Laws or other requirements. "Law" means any law, rule, regulation, ordinance, statute, judicial decision, administrative order, Utility or pipeline business practices or protocol, Utility or pipeline tariff, rule of any commission or agency with jurisdiction in the state in which the Accounts are located. Any such increase may be reflected as an increased price or as a separate line item or invoice. If there is a Change in Law which results in Constellation being prevented, prohibited, or frustrated from carrying out the terms of this Agreement, Constellation may terminate this Agreement.
