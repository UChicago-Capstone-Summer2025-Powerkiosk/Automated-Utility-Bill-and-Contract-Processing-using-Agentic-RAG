1. Transactions: The terms of this CMA apply to all end-use sales of electric power ("Electricity") and/or natural gas ("Gas") as applicable (each a "Commodity" and collectively, the "Commodities"), by the applicable Seller party to Buyer (each sale a "Transaction") which will be memorialized in a writing signed by both Parties (each a "Transaction Confirmation"). Each Transaction Confirmation shall set forth the Seller party providing service to Customer for such Transaction. If a conflict arises between the terms of this CMA and a Transaction Confirmation, the Transaction Confirmation will control with respect to that particular Transaction. This CMA, any amendments to this CMA and related Transaction Confirmation(s) (together, a single integrated, "Agreement") is the entire understanding between Parties with respect to the Commodities and supersedes all other communication and prior writings with respect thereto; no oral statements are effective.
2. Performance: The Parties' obligations under this Agreement are firm. Buyer is obligated to purchase and receive, and Seller is obligated to sell and provide, the Contract Quantity of Commodity specified in a Transaction Confirmation in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Buyer will only use the Commodity at the listed Service Locations in the applicable Transaction Confirmation and will not resell the Commodity or use it at other locations without Seller's prior written consent.
3. Purchase Price: Buyer will pay the Purchase Price stated in each Transaction Confirmation. If the Purchase Price Incorporates an Index and the Index is not announced or published on any day for any reason or if the Seller reasonably determines that a material change in the formula for or the method of determining the Purchase Price has occurred, then the Parties will use a commercially reasonable replacement price that is calculated by the Seller. If Seller concludes that a change in any Law(s) increases Seller's costs, the Purchase Price may be adjusted by Seller to reflect such costs. "Law(s)" mean all tariffs, laws, orders, rules, decisions, taxes, regulations, transmission rates, and Utility changes to Buyer's monthly capacity and/or transmission obligations.
4. Billing and Payment: Seller will invoice Buyer for the Actual Quantity of Commodity and for any other amounts incurred by Buyer under this Agreement. Payment is due within fifteen (15) days of the date of the invoice. If an invoice is issued and the Actual Quantity cannot be verified by the time, the invoice will be based on Seller's good faith estimate of the Actual Quantity. Seller will adjust Buyer's account following (i) confirmation of the Actual Quantity, (ii) any Utility discrepancy or adjustment or (iii) any other corrections or adjustments, including adjustments to, or re-calculation of, Taxes. Buyer will pay interest on late payments at $1.5 \%$ per month or, if lower, the maximum rate permitted by law ("Interest Rate").

Buyer will reimburse Seller for any Taxes that Seller is required to collect and pay on Buyer's behalf and will indemnify, defend and hold Seller harmless from any liability against all Buyer's Taxes. Buyer will furnish Seller with any necessary documentation showing its exemption from Taxes, if applicable, and Buyer will be liable for any Taxes assessed against Seller because of Buyer's failure to timely provide or properly complete any such documentation. "Taxes" means all applicable federal, state and local taxes, including any associated penalties and interest and any new taxes imposed in the future during the term of this Agreement. Liabilities imposed in this Section will survive the termination of this Agreement.

The Parties will negotiate in good faith regarding such dispute for a period of not more than fifteen (15) Business Days. In the event the Parties are unable to resolve such dispute, the disputing Party will pay the balance of the original invoice and either Party may exercise any remedy available to it in law or equity pursuant to this Agreement.
