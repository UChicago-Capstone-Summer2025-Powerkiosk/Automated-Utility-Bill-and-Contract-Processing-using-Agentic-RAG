This Commodity Master Agreement ("CMA") among Direct Energy Business, LLC and NRG Business Marketing LLC, (collectively "Seller"), each a Delaware limited liability company, and BIRDSONG CORPORATION ("Buyer" or "Customer") (each a "Party" and collectively, the "Parties") is entered into and effective as of December 21, 2023.

1. Transactions: The terms of this CMA apply to all end-use sales of electric power and/or natural gas as applicable (each a "Commodity" and collectively, the "Commodities"), by the applicable Seller to Buyer (each sale a "Transaction") which will be memorialized in a transaction confirmation signed by both Parties (each a "Transaction Confirmation"). Each Transaction Confirmation shall set forth the Seller party providing service to Customer for such Transaction. This CMA, any amendments to this CMA and related Transaction Confirmation(s) (together, a single integrated, "Agreement") is the entire understanding between Parties with respect to the Commodities and supersedes all other communication and prior writings with respect thereto; no oral statements are effective.
2. Performance: Buyer is obligated to purchase and receive, and Seller is obligated to sell and provide, the Contract Quantity of Commodity specified in a Transaction Confirmation. Buyer will only use the Commodity at the listed Service Locations in the applicable Transaction Confirmation and will not resell the Commodity.
3. Term: The Delivery Period and any Renewal Term are set forth in the applicable Transaction Confirmation. This CMA shall remain in effect until terminated by either Party pursuant to Section 14 or as otherwise terminated by either Party for convenience upon at least 30 days' prior written notice; provided, however, that this CMA will remain in effect with respect to Transactions entered into prior to the effective date of the termination until both Parties have fulfilled all outstanding obligations.
4. Purchase Price: Buyer will pay the Purchase Price stated in each Transaction Confirmation, subject to Sections 5 and 10. If the Purchase Price incorporates an index and the index is not announced or published on any day for any reason or if the Seller reasonably determines that a material change in the formula for or the method of determining the Purchase Price has occurred, then the Parties will use a commercially reasonable replacement price calculated by the Seller.
5. Changes to Purchase Price: In the event there is a change to any tariff, law, order, rule, tax, regulation, transmission rate, or any LDC, EDC or ISO changes to supplier obligations to serve, which increase Seller's costs, the Purchase Price may be adjusted by Seller to include such costs.
6. Billing and Payment: Seller will invoice Buyer for the Actual Quantity of Commodity and for any other amounts for which Buyer is responsible under this Agreement. Except as otherwise set forth herein, payment is due within 15 days of the date of the invoice. If Seller cannot verify the Actual Quantity at the time an invoice is issued, Seller will estimate the Actual Quantity. Seller will adjust Buyer's account following (i) confirmation of the Actual Quantity, (ii) any Utility adjustment or (iii) any other corrections or adjustments, including adjustments to, or re-calculation of Taxes. Buyer will pay interest on late payments for any amount due under this Agreement at $1.50 \%$ per month or, if lower, the maximum rate permitted by law ("Interest Rate"). Buyer is also responsible for all costs and fees, including reasonable attorney's fees, incurred in collecting any amounts owed to Seller and any fee charged to Seller for insufficient funds of Buyer. "Actual Quantity" means the actual quantity of Commodity that is either delivered or metered, as applicable, to Buyer's account. "Utility" means a state regulated entity engaged in the distribution of the applicable Commodity.
7. Taxes: The Purchase Price does not include Taxes that are or may be the responsibility of the Buyer, unless such inclusion is required by law. Buyer will reimburse Seller for any Taxes that Seller is required to collect and pay on Buyer's behalf and will indemnify, defend and hold Seller harmless from any liability against all Taxes for which Buyer is responsible. Buyer must provide Seller with any applicable Tax exemption documentation and Buyer will be liable for any Taxes assessed against Seller because of Buyer's failure to timely provide or properly complete any such documentation. "Taxes" means all applicable federal, state and local taxes, including any associated penalties and interest and any new taxes imposed in the future during the term of this Agreement. Liabilities imposed in this Section will survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement.
8. Disputes: If either Party in good faith disputes amounts owed hereunder, the disputing Party will contact the non-disputing Party in writing and pay the undisputed amount by the payment due date. The Parties will have 15 Business Days to negotiate a resolution. If such dispute is not resolved, the disputing Party will pay the balance of the original invoice and either Party may exercise any remedy available to it at law or equity. "Business Day" means any day on which banks are open for commercial business in New York, New York; any reference to "day(s)" means calendar days.
9. Title and Risk of Loss: Title to, possession of and risk of loss to the Commodity will pass to Buyer at the Delivery Point specified in the applicable Transaction Confirmation.
10. Material Deviation: Seller may in its sole discretion pass through to Buyer any losses and/or costs incurred by Seller related to a deviation of $+/-25 \%$ from Contract Quantity (or, as applicable, estimated Contract Quantities) stated in the applicable Transaction Confirmation (which is not caused by weather).
11. Force Majeure: Other than payment obligations, a Party claiming Force Majeure will be excused from its obligations under Section 2 only if it provides prompt notice of the Force Majeure, uses due diligence to remove its cause and resumes performance as promptly as reasonably possible. During a Force Majeure, Buyer will not be excused from its responsibility to pay for Balancing Charges nor from its responsibility to pay for Commodity received. "Force Majeure" means a material, unavoidable occurrence beyond a Party's control, and does not include inability to pay, an increase or decrease in Taxes or the cost of Commodity, the economic hardships of a Party, the full or partial closure of Buyer's facilities, unless such closure itself is due to Force Majeure.

12. Financial Responsibility: Seller's entry into this Agreement and each Transaction is conditioned on Buyer, its parent, any guarantor or any successor maintaining its creditworthiness during the Delivery Period and any Renewal Term. When Seller has reasonable grounds for insecurity regarding Buyer's ability or willingness to perform all of its outstanding obligations under any agreement between the Parties, Seller may require Buyer to provide adequate assurance, which may include, in the Seller's discretion, security in the form of cash deposits, prepayments, letters of credit or other guaranty of payment or performance ("Credit Assurance").
13. Default: "Default" means: (i) failure of either Party to make payment by the applicable due date and the payment is not made within 3 Business Days of a written demand; (ii) failure of Buyer to provide Credit Assurance within 2 Business Days of Seller's demand; (iii) any representation or warranty made by a Party in this Agreement proves to have been false or misleading in any material respect when made or ceases to remain true and such breach is not cured within 15 Business Days after written notice; (iv) a secured party has taken possession of all or any substantial portion of its assets or is dissolved or has a resolution passed for its winding-up, official management or liquidation (other than pursuant to a consolidation or merger; (v) failure of a Party to fulfill any of its obligations in this Agreement (except as otherwise provided in subsections (i), (ii) (iii) and (iv) hereof) and such failure is not cured within 15 Business Days after written notice; provided that no cure period or demand for cure applies to an early termination of a Transaction Confirmation by Buyer or under Section 15(A)(iii).
14. Remedies: In the event of a Default, the non-defaulting Party may: (i) withhold any payments or suspend performance; (ii) accelerate any amounts owing between the Parties and terminate any Transactions and/or this Agreement between the Parties and/or their affiliates; (iii) calculate a settlement amount by calculating all amounts due to Seller for Actual Quantity and the Close-out Value for each Transaction being terminated; and/or (iv) net or aggregate all settlement amounts and all other amounts owing between the Parties and their affiliates under this Agreement and other energy-related agreements between them and their affiliates, whether or not due and whether or not subject to any contingencies, plus costs, into one single amount ("Net Settlement Amount"). Any Net Settlement Amount due from the defaulting Party to the non-defaulting Party will be paid within 3 Business Days of written notice from the non-defaulting Party. Interest on any unpaid portion of the Net Settlement Amount will accrue daily at the Interest Rate. "Close-out Value" is the sum of (a) the amount due to the non-defaulting Party regarding the Contract Quantities (or, as applicable, estimated Contract Quantities) remaining to be delivered as stated in the applicable Transaction Confirmation(s) during the Delivery Period or, if applicable, the current Renewal Term, calculated by determining the difference between the Purchase Price and the Market Price for such quantities; and (b) without duplication, any net losses or costs incurred by the non-defaulting Party for terminating the Transaction(s), including costs of obtaining, maintaining and/or liquidating commercially reasonable hedges, Balancing Charges and/or transaction costs. "Market Price" means the price for similar quantities of Commodity at the Delivery Point during the Delivery Period or Renewal Term. For purposes of determining Close-out Value, Market Price may be established by Seller through information available to Seller internally or through third parties. The Parties agree that Close-out Value constitutes a reasonable approximation of damages and is not a penalty or punitive in any respect. Physical liquidation of a Transaction or entering into a replacement transaction is not required to determine Close-out Value or Net Settlement Amount. The defaulting Party is responsible for all costs and fees incurred for collection of Net Settlement Amount, including, reasonable attorney's fees and expert witness fees.
