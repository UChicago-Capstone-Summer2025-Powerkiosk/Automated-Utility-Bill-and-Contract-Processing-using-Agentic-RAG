## 2) Safety Messages from Ameren Illinois

Save valuable time for first responders by ensuring your building or resident address is clearly marked. In an emergency situation such as a fire, gas leak or downed power line, every minute counts. Display your address using large painted numbers or signs on your curb, mailbox or other designated area.

Important Message for Gas Customers - Be Safe If you ever smell gas, call Ameren Illinois at 1.800.755.5000 to investigate the problem. We respond to gas odors 24 hours a day, 7 days a week and there is no charge.

Don't go outside in the dark after a severe storm because you may not be able to see a downed power line that could still be energized and dangerous. Stay away from brush, fallen trees or puddles that could hide downed lines.

## 3 Tips from Ameren Illinois

If your facility has ceiling fans, operate them year round to reduce energy use during both heating and cooling seasons. In warmer months, circulating air feels cooler; in colder months, fans help push warm air down from the ceiling.
