This bill reflects increases in the Delivery and Supply portions of your electric bill effective on and after February 1, 2023. The changes in the Delivery portion are due to increases in the Zero Emission Certificate Recovery Charge and the Solar Pilot Recovery Charge. The change in the Supply portion is the result of changes to the Transmission rate. The overall increase for business customers will vary by individual customer usage. Tariff information may also be found by visiting pseg.com.

PSEG is proud to be named to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index and to Newsweek's America's Most Responsible Companies 2023 list. These prestigious honors demonstrate PSEG's ongoing commitment to environmental, social and governance (ESG) initiatives.

Heating can be a big part of your business's energy costs. To save energy and money, we recommend setting thermostats between $66^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$ $68^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$ during heating months. For more tips, visit pseg.com/bizenergytips.
