Currency Cost Price: The Currency Cost Price is to recover costs in relation to the anticipated variation between the dual currencies applied in the trading day exchange rate and at the Invoice day exchange rate.

Residual Error Volume Charge: The Residual Error Volume Charge is the charge to cover the anticipated net imbalance over the year.

## E. DUoS CHARGES

1. Distribution tariffs are the Charges paid for using the distribution system. The tariffs are paid by the suppliers who use the system, and are passed on to end-users, including the Customer.
2. The CRU periodically carries out full reviews of ESB Networks' costs incurred in owning and operating the distribution system to ensure that only efficient levels of costs are collected through the distribution tariffs. The tariffs are updated annually.
3. The revenue the DSO is allowed to collect from customers is updated and refined each year and these 'allowed revenues' are used to calculate the distribution use of system, DUoS, tariffs, which are approved by the CRU. DUoS tariffs are charged to suppliers on the basis of the amount of network

capacity and energy used by their customers and includes standing Charges. There are different DUoS tariffs as confirmed annually by the CRU for different types of Customers, which are as follows:

Note: "Low Voltage" is 230 V single phase, or 400 V three phase. "Medium Voltage" is 10 kV or 20 kV . "MD" is Maximum Demand, which is a term that relates to the way some customers are charged based on their maximum electrical capacity. "Looped" is a term used for larger customers who have a standby connection.
4. The combination of the type of use, the nature of the connecting network, the MIC, the MEC and the metering installation in the customer's connection agreement determines the DUoS Group.

# F. TUoS CHARGES 

1. To set such Charges, the CRU first determines the revenues that the transmission business can earn to cover the costs of both the TSO and the TAO. Each year the allowed revenue is refined in an annual review that updates a range of assumptions. This determines the allowed revenue in that relevant year which is then used to calculate tariffs and Charges to users of the transmission system.
2. The transmission tariffs that are approved by the CRU each year include TUoS Charges to generators and to Customers.

## G. PENALTY CHARGES

For Customers directly connected to the Distribution Network, there are two possible penalties:
a) Low Power Factor Surcharge: The low power factor surcharge applies when the metered kVArh is more than one third of the metered kWh in any two monthly period where NQH metering is installed or any monthly period where on-line interval, QH , metering is installed. The charge is applicable to the kVArh in excess of one third of the kWh for the billing period as calculated pursuant to the relevant Schedule of DUoS Charges.
b) Breach of MIC: In the event that the peak demand (in kVA), exceeds the maximum import capacity (MIC), a surcharge of 6 x capacity charge rate $x$ excess kVA will apply in the billing period for NQH installations and 5 x capacity charge rate $x$ excess kVA for QH installations in the billing period, during which the MIC was exceeded. These multipliers are subject to charge.

For Customers directly connected to the Transmission Network, there is one possible penalty:
a) Breach of Demand Network Unauthorised Usage Charge: In the event that the peak demand (in kVA) exceeds the Customer's maximum import capacity (MIC) for the charging period, a surcharge of 6542 , which is subject to charge, $x$ MWh excess will apply in the billing period, during which the MIC was exceeded.

## H. PSO CHARGES

1. The Public Service Obligation (PSO) charge is levied on all consumers of electricity, regardless of supplier, and appears a separate item on customer bills. All PSO Charges incurred in the provision of electricity by Flogas Enterprise to the Customer will be paid by the Customer.

# I. ELECTRICITY TAX CHARGES 

The Electricity Tax Charge represents an excise duty on electricity as required under the EU Energy Tax Directive 2003/96/EC. The Electricity Tax Charge will apply to all supplies of electricity made on or after $1^{\text {st }}$ October 2008 by Flogas Enterprise to the Customer under this Agreement. The Tax Charge will be calculated pursuant to the appropriate charge rate applied. Where electricity is supplied to the Customer for Business Use a charge rate of $€ 1.00$ per megawatt hour will be applied. Where electricity is supplied to the Customer for Non-Business Use a charge rate of $€ 1.00$ per megawatt hour will be applied. The rates of Electricity Tax are subject to change.

## J. ENERGY EFFICIENCY SCHEME CHARGE

The Energy Efficiency Scheme Charge represents the cost of the energy efficiency obligation scheme, which has been established to comply with European Union energy legislation.

3. Cost of consumed electricity:

During any given month in the Fixed Supply Period and in addition to any applicable charges calculated in accordance with 5. below, the Customer shall incur the cost of the volume of Day electricity consumed multiplied by the Fixed Price for Day electricity plus the cost of the volume of Night electricity consumed multiplied by the Fixed Price for Night electricity.
4. Usage Tolerance:

During any given month in the Fixed Supply Period and where the Fixed Volume represents 100\% of the Customers expected consumption for the month, the Customer shall be permitted to use a maximum of (100)\%, or a minimum of (90)\% ("Usage Tolerance"), of i) the Day Fixed Volume and ii) separately, the Night Fixed Volume at the relevant Fixed Price for a given month. For clarity, if the Customer's usage in any given month is within these tolerance levels, no calculations made in accordance with 5 . below will be applied.
5. Treatment of consumption outside Usage Tolerance:

If the Customer uses in any month during the Fixed Supply Period a quantity of Day electricity or, separately, of Night electricity, which either (a) exceeds $105 \%$ of the Fixed Volume, such excess being a "Top Up", or (b) is less than $95 \%$ of the Fixed Volume, such shortfall being an "Underuse", in each case other than due to the default of Flogas Enterprise, the Customer shall reimburse Flogas Enterprise any costs, expenses or liability incurred by Flogas Enterprise.

In the event of a Top Up in a given month during the Fixed Supply Period the Customer shall incur the cost, if positive, of purchasing:
i) the additional Day electricity used in that month, which shall be calculated as being the Top Up multiplied by the result of the Day Top Up Volume Weighted Average Day Ahead Trade Price ("VWAP ${ }_{10}$ ") minus the Fixed Price; and
ii) the additional Night electricity used in that month, which shall be calculated as being the Top Up multiplied by the result of the Night Volume Weighted Average Day Ahead Trade Price ("VWAP ${ }_{1 N}$ ") minus the Fixed Price.

The Day Top Up Volume Weighted Average Day Ahead Trade Price ("VWAP ${ }_{10}$ ") shall be calculated as follows:

$$
V W A P T D=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}\left(T D_{i} \times P_{D A_{i}}\right)+\cdots+\left(T D_{n} \times P_{D A_{n}}\right)}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} T D_{i}+\cdots+T D_{n}}
$$

Where:
n is the total number of Day Ahead Trading Periods for Day electricity in a given month
$Q D_{i}$ is the quantity of Day electricity consumed in Day Ahead Trading Period $i$
$T D_{i}$ is the value of $Q D_{i}$ minus the Fixed Volume Period in Day Ahead Trading Period $i$
Fixed Volume Period is the Fixed Volume in a given month divided by $n$
$P_{D A_{i}}$ is the Day Ahead Trade Price in the corresponding Day Ahead Trading Period $i$

The Night Top Up Volume Weighted Average Day Ahead Trade Price ("VWAP ${ }_{1 N}$ ") shall be calculated as follows:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& V W A P T N=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}\left(T N_{i} \times P_{D A_{i}}\right)+\cdots+\left(T N_{n} \times P_{D A_{n}}\right)}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} T N_{i}+\cdots+T N_{n}} \\
& \text { Where: } \\
& \text { n is the total number of Day Ahead Trading Periods for Night electricity in a given month } \\
& Q N_{i} \text { is the quantity of Night electricity consumed in Day Ahead Trading Period } i \\
& T N_{i} \text { is the value of } Q N_{i} \text { minus the Fixed Volume Period in Day Ahead Trading Period } i \\
& \text { Fixed Volume Period is the Fixed Volume in a given month divided by } n \\
& P_{D A_{i}} \text { is the Day Ahead Trade Price in the corresponding Day Ahead Trading Period } i
\end{aligned}
$$

In the event of an Underuse in a given month during the Fixed Supply Period the Customer shall incur the cost, if positive, of:
i) the underused Day electricity in that month, which shall be calculated as being the Underuse multiplied by result of the Fixed Price less the Day Underuse Volume Weighted Average Day Ahead Trade Price ("VWAP ${ }_{10}$ "); and
ii) the underused Night electricity in that month, which shall be calculated as being the Underuse multiplied by result of the Fixed Price less the Night Underuse Volume Weighted Average Day Ahead Trade Price ("VWAP ${ }_{10}$ ").

The Day Underuse Volume Weighted Average Day Ahead Trade Price ("VWAP ${ }_{10}$ ") shall be calculated as follows:

$$
