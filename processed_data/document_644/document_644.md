### 811 Before You Dig

Whether you're planting a garden or trees, putting in a new fence or mailbox, or engaging in any other project that involves digging, know what's below and 811 Before You Dig!

Indiana's "Call Before You Dig" law requires everyone who digs, including private property owners, to contact Indiana 811 at least two full working days before starting a project. When you submit a ticket on indiana811.org or call 811, utility crews have time to mark the locations of underground utility lines on your property. The service is meant to keep you and your family safe and is provided free of charge.

## Citizens' Natural Gas Utility Performed Well During Cold Snap

Citizens Energy Group's natural gas utility serving Marion County performed exceptionally well throughout the very cold weather that spread across the U.S. in February. While some utilities across the country experienced service disruptions and natural gas price spikes, Citizens was able to deliver reliable service at lower costs thanks to our natural gas storage assets, gas supply planning, and access to multiple interstate natural gas pipelines. As a result, Marion County customers will see a favorable impact on future monthly bills.

## Assistance Is Still Available

If you are behind on or need help paying your utility bills, financial assistance is still available, including the Energy Assistance Program (EAP). Citizens urges customers needing financial assistance to apply for EAP to automatically qualify for additional help from Citizens Energy Group.
