Customer agrees to take steps to cooperate with Company's efforts to perform enrollment of Accounts for supply under this Agreement. Customer understands the Utility determines final enrollment and agrees that Company is not liable for any delay or failure in enrolling Customer's Account(s) if such delay or failure is due to incorrect Account information, invalid Account numbers, and/or any other cause beyond Company's control. Further, notwithstanding any provision in the Agreement to the contrary, it is possible that for various reasons such as the Account not existing, Account not active, Account is not the "first in" and/or a required permit for the Account is not valid with the Utility, some or all the Accounts cannot be enrolled. All such un-enrolled Accounts shall be automatically deleted from the list of Accounts under this Agreement without an amendment to this Agreement. Company has the right to treat one or more failures to enroll any Accounts as an early termination of this Agreement. If one or more Accounts fail to enroll on a timely basis based on inaccurate information from Customer and/or any other cause beyond Company's control, Customer may, at the option of Company, be required to pay Company the Early Termination Fee due with respect to such Accounts. Company is not required to serve any such un-enrolled Accounts.
5. TERM OF AGREEMENT. This Agreement shall become effective on the Effective Date, with service commencing for each respective Account(s) on the Service Commencement Date, and shall continue for the Initial Term. After the Initial Term expires, this Agreement shall continue on a month-to-month basis at the Holdover Price unless and until either Party terminates this Agreement upon at least thirty (30) days written notice, in which event such termination shall be effective after the noticed termination date on the date on which the Utility successfully switches Customer's Account(s) to another competitive electricity supplier or to the Utility's generation service.
6. PRICING AND PASS-THROUGH CHARGES. The Price for electric supply provided to Customer by Company during the Initial Term is set forth in the BEA
and subject to any adjustments set forth in this Agreement.

Customer pays all Pass-Through Charges, which are charges to Customer, not credits. For any loss or charge which Company has the right to bill to Customer under this Agreement, Company reserves the right not to impose such cost or charge during any given billing period (e.g., if the amount is de minimis or Company chooses not to incur the administrative costs of billing). Customer understands that Company's lack of billing of a cost or charge will not be a waiver of such billing right, and Company has the right, but not the obligation, to bill such cost or charge, or cost or charge category, at a later date if it chooses. Pass-Through Charges are generally passed-through directly to each Account unless the Company determines that another method is appropriate. These methods include using a loadsharing basis or other reasonable basis, as determined by Company. Depending on the bill format, certain Pass-Through Charges, including those arising from one or more [Insert if BCA: Change in Law events, may appear on the bill as a separate line item or an increase to the Price shown on the bill, at the option of Company.
The unit price for electricity during the Holdover Period shall be the Holdover Price, not the Price. The Holdover Price is a variable price and determined by Company in its sole discretion. The Holdover Price can be based on a variety of factors, and is not solely driven by current and future market prices or risks. The Holdover Price can change without prior notice to Customer unless required by law. In some cases, the Holdover Price may vary significantly from the Price charged during the Initial Term of this Agreement. The following are some, but not all, of the material factors that can influence Company's determination of the initial Holdover Price and any subsequent changes to the Holdover Price: (i) the current and future expected prices for wholesale electric supply (including an analysis of the supply and demand factors affecting these prices, if desired) and Company desired risk premiums on any pricing; (ii) Company's supply position in the market and its comfort level with respect to those positions; (iii) Company's expected gross margin, target gross and profit margins, and desired revenues; (iv) Company's Customer counts and attrition; and/or (v) the prices charged by competitors and the Utility.

The Parties understand and agree that the RPS Charge is based on a REC and obligation costing allocation mechanism based on periodic estimates that will likely not reflect the final actual cost of such RECs and obligations, and the Parties agree to accept such risk. Company will determine the monthly RPS Charge in its sole discretion based on its then-current estimate of the cost of such RECs and obligations, and the published energy portfolio obligations, but such charges will be ongoing, and it shall not be required to provide a credit if the actual cost to purchase RECs and obligations for a month is less than the RPS Charge for such month. Company will determine, in its sole discretion, its strategy for purchasing RECs and obligations, including the timing, frequency, volume, and actual price it pays for such RECs and obligations.
7. BILLING AND FEES. Each month, Customer shall pay the Company Electricity Charge. Unless the Parties agree in writing to alternate payment arrangements, Customer consents to be billed monthly for supply and any services provided hereunder through one of the following billing options, as permitted by law, at Company's discretion: (i) Customer will receive one bill from the Utility that includes the Company Electricity Charge, the Delivery Charges and applicable Taxes, (the "Consolidated Billing Option"); or (ii) Customer will receive two bills, one from Company for the Company Electricity Charge and one from the Utility for the Delivery Charges, each with applicable Taxes (the "Dual Billing Option"). Under the Consolidated Billing Option, Customer will make payments directly to the Utility pursuant to the applicable Utility tariff. Under the Dual Billing Option, Customer shall pay each Company bill within the number of days after the date of each such bill, as such number is set forth in the BEA. If, under the Consolidated Billing Option or Dual Billing Option, any payment for the Company Electricity Charge made by Customer to Company or to the Utility is late under the applicable payment terms, Customer may be assessed the Late Fee and its delinquent balances may be reported to a credit agency. Further, in addition to any other rights of Company hereunder, if, during the Dual Billing Option, any payment for the Company Electricity Charge is late under the applicable payment terms, then Company shall have the right, without prior notice to the Customer, to convert all billing hereunder to the Consolidated Billing Option and convert the Price as
necessary, on a commercial reasonable basis, to a fixed price sufficient to enable such Consolidated Billing.

Company may apply any credit balance on a particular Account to a balance owed on any other Customer Account. Further, Company has the right to set off any amounts owed by Company to Customer under this Agreement against any amounts owed by Customer to Company or its affiliates. Company may assess a twenty five dollar (\$25) fee against any transaction not processed due to insufficient funds or credit availability for any method of payment, including checks, bank drafts or credit card. If the Utility fails to timely obtain or transmit a meter reading, Company will issue or cause to be issued a bill to Customer based on its estimated Energy Usage and charges during the Billing Cycle. Company will include or cause to be included in any subsequent bill from Company, adjustments related to previous billings, including estimates, previous billing errors, meter read errors, or other errors or omissions. If one or more Pass-Through Charges are involved in deferred billing, Company has the right to estimate the Pass-Through Charges on the bills in the interim and Customer shall pay Company such estimated Pass-Through Charges. Customer's Energy Usage is determined for the applicable Settlement Interval as follows: IDR meters (interval meter data) are billed using the interval meter data provided by the Utility, (ii) scalar meters (non-interval meter data) are billed using the applicable load profile provided by the Utility to convert the actual meter read usage per unit provided by the Utility into interval usage data, and/or (iii) AMS meters are billed using the applicable load profile provided by the Utility until such time as the AMS meter read data is incorporated into the Company's billing system.
8. CREDIT AND DEPOSIT REQUIREMENTS. If Company determines, prior to offering service or at any time during the term of this Agreement, that Customer cannot demonstrate satisfactory creditworthiness, Customer has failed to timely pay all amounts due under this Agreement or there otherwise exists an Event of Default with respect to Customer under this Agreement, Company has the right to require Customer to either make advanced payments or provide to Company performance assurance to ensure prompt and timely payments of amounts due to Company under this Agreement. If, after Customer has

been required to make advanced payments or provide performance assurance, Company determines that Customer's credit is unsatisfactory, Company has the right to require Customer to provide additional performance assurance. Customer shall post with Company any initial or additional performance assurance within three (3) days after the date on which Company made a demand for such performance assurance. The amount and form of initial or additional performance assurance will be determined by Company in a commercially reasonable manner. Cash deposits posted as performance assurance, if any, held by Company more than thirty (30) days will accrue interest from the date of receipt at the annual rate established by the applicable state's Public Utility Commission (or similarly named authority) and such accrued interest will be applied annually to Customer's account. After termination of this Agreement or disconnection of supply, Company will apply any cash deposit plus any unpaid accrued interest toward any outstanding balance on Customer's final bill and will refund any remaining deposit.
9. TERMINATION OF AGREEMENT. If Customer commits or is otherwise subject to an Event of Default in whole or with respect to one or more Accounts then, in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other remedy Company may have in law or equity, Company has the right to terminate this Agreement. Company has the right to terminate this Agreement in whole, or in part as to any affected Account(s), as determined solely by the Company. If the Agreement is so terminated by Company, Customer shall pay Company for all amounts owed up to the date of such termination, including all electricity supplied, any other products and services provided to Customer through the date of such termination, and any applicable Late Fees. Further, Customer shall pay Company the sum of any Costs plus the greater of the Early Termination Fee or damages to Company. Such damages, if any, will be calculated based upon the value of the product of (i) the difference between the applicable Price(s) and the market price(s) for the same quantities of energy which would have been supplied hereunder for the remainder of the Initial Term, and (ii) the estimated Energy Usage by Customer, as determined by Company, during the remainder of the Initial Term. To determine "market prices," as used above, Company may consider, among other things, settlement prices of
applicable NYMEX futures contracts, quotations from leading dealers in energy swap contracts and other bona fide offers from parties participating in the wholesale and/or retail electricity markets, which may include affiliates of Company. In addition, if an Early Supply Switch occurs without Company receiving at least thirty (30) days' advance notice from Customer, Customer shall pay Company the Insufficient Notice Fee. Company will not be required to enter into any replacement transaction in order to determine Costs, the Early Termination Fee, market prices or damages. The Parties agree that the amounts recoverable hereunder are a reasonable estimate of loss and not a penalty.

If Company terminates the Agreement, the Company has the right, and Customer hereby authorizes Company, to enroll all Customer's Account(s) with the Utility which would provide supply pursuant to its rules.

## 10. TITLE, RISK OF LOSS AND INDEMNIFICATION.

Title and risk of loss to the electricity sold under this Agreement passes from Company to Customer when the electricity is delivered to the Delivery Point for each Account(s). Customer agrees that Company does not control the physical electricity sold under this Agreement, which electricity flows through the Utility transmission and/or delivery systems, and accordingly, Company shall not be responsible for any failure in the Utility transmission or delivery system. Customer shall indemnify and defend Company from all Claims arising from or out of any event, act or incident occurring when or after the title to the electricity passes to Customer.
11. FORCE MAJEURE. Each Party shall be excused from performance of its obligations under this Agreement, in whole or in part, to the extent caused by or related to an event of Force Majeure; provided, that, except with regard to outages or failures of the transmission and distribution lines controlled by the Utility: (i) the claiming party shall provide notice of Force Majeure to the other Party within a reasonable time after the event; and (ii) the claiming Party shall have used commercially reasonable efforts to avoid the effects of such Force Majeure and shall resume performance under this Agreement as soon as commercially reasonable.

12. CHANGE IN LAW. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, if there is one or more Change in Law events and such event, either independently or in conjunction with one or more other events (including an auction), results in Company incurring new or increased costs or charges related to providing retail electric supply or any other products or services under this Agreement, Customer shall pay Company such new or increased costs or charges as Pass-Through Charges. In calculating the cost or charge, if the increase is not reasonably evident from the Change in Law itself, or if the costs or charges subsequently increase based on another event, including a subsequent auction, Company may calculate the increase based on the charge or cost incurred after the Change in Law event as compared to Company's earlier estimates of the relevant cost(s) or charge(s).
13. NON-DISCRIMINATION. Company does not discriminate against any Customer based wholly or partly on race, color, creed, national origin, or sex, of an applicant for service or for any arbitrary, capricious, or unfairly discriminatory reason.
14. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. Each of the following representations and warranties are deemed to be continuing throughout the term of this Agreement, unless stated otherwise.

28. TRANSACTION EXECUTION PROCEDURES. The provisions set forth below apply to any Hedge Adjustments made under this Agreement. Hedge Adjustments are intended to allow the Customer to make changes to the price structure of electricity purchased under this Agreement. Hedge Adjustments are only made pursuant to one or more confirmations under this Agreement and such confirmations require the mutual agreement of the Parties. Neither Party is under any obligation to transact any Hedge Adjustments. Customer authorizes Company to perform, on behalf of Customer, all Hedge Adjustments. Following each Hedge Adjustment, if any, Customer shall continue to pay Company the Company Electricity Charge and any other amounts due under this Agreement.
(i) Requests. Customer may request a quote from Company for pricing associated with a potential Hedge Adjustment during the Initial Term. If the request is for the purchase of new or additional block quantities of electricity ("Additional Blocks"), the minimum block quantity available to purchase is 1 MW unless Company, in its sole discretion, agrees to a lesser amount. Customer may also request a quote for gas index prices pursuant to an addendum to this Agreement. To make any of these requests, Customer shall email Company at the two Company email addresses set forth below advising Company of the requested transaction. Company is under no obligation to agree to accept any order.

(a) Recordings. Hedge Adjustments under this Agreement may be conducted by the Parties on Company's recorded telephone line at (713) 401-5712 before 1:00 p.m., Houston, Texas time, on any day in which a quote has been issued by Company, NYMEX is trading Henry Hub Natural Gas Futures Contracts and Company's main business office is open. Each such transaction must be made through the participation of at least one authorized representative of each Party on the telephone line, and Customer's representative must be one of the persons authorized below. Subject to this section and market movement, upon receipt of an order from Customer and Company's agreement to such order, Company shall work to execute the requested transaction.
(b) Confirmations of Recordings. After Company's execution of the transaction on behalf of Customer, Company shall send Customer a written confirmation via email indicating the executed transaction terms. Any dispute by Customer to the terms set forth in the written confirmation must be raised by Customer before the end of the business day following delivery of the confirmation. Customer shall initiate such dispute only by contacting the Company recorded line (telephone number is in the previous paragraph) before the expiration of such business day. If Customer fails to dispute the confirmation by the end of the business day following delivery of the confirmation, then the unsigned confirmation is, absent manifest error, the Parties' binding agreement with respect to the transaction.
(c) Supporting Evidence. Each Party hereby consents to the creation of an electronic recording (including digital or tape) by Company or its representative of all telephone conversations regarding transactions under this Agreement and such recordings shall be conclusive evidence of the transactions. Each Party agrees not to contest any such election or determination in connection therewith based on the statute of frauds or any law requiring agreements to be in writing.

(iii) Written Transactions. In lieu of using Recorded Telephone Transactions as set forth in the previous subsection, H edge Adjustments may be transacted by the Parties in writing on any day NYMEX is trading Henry Hub Natural Gas Futures Contracts and Company's main business office is open. To execute a written H edge Adjustment transaction, Customer shall email Company at the email addresses under the Company Contact Information for Commercial Sales and Additional Transactions set forth in the BEA advising Company of the requested transaction and attaching a signed hedge request. Company is under no obligation to agree to accept any order. Upon receipt of such signed hedge request, Company will work to execute the requested transaction at or near the requested terms. After Company's execution of the transaction on behalf of Customer, Company shall send Customer a written confirmation via email indicating the executed transaction terms. Any dispute by Customer to the terms set forth in the written confirmation must be raised by Customer before the end of the business day following delivery of the confirmation. Customer shall initiate such dispute only by email to the Company email addresses before the expiration of such business day. If Customer fails to dispute the confirmation by the end of the business day following delivery of the confirmation, then the unsigned confirmation is, absent manifest error, the Parties' binding agreement with respect to the transaction.
(iv) Representatives. All communications with respect to orders and H edge Adjustment transactions, including emails requesting price quotes and sending H edge Adjustment confirmations, shall be sent to Company using the Company Contact Information for Commercial Sales and Additional Transactions set forth in the BEA.

All communications for orders and H edge Adjustment transactions, including emails requesting price quotes and sending H edge Adjustment confirmations, shall be made between Company and the authorized representative of Customer whose name and contact information is set forth on the BEA. Customer authorizes such representative to enter into binding transactions pursuant to this Agreement. Customer shall provide to Company advance written notice indicating new or amended authorized representative information if Customer desires change such
information. Otherwise, Company shall be entitled to rely on such representative, or any officer of Customer, as authorized agent of Customer for all transactions conducted under this Agreement.
(v) Execution Limitations. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, the Parties agree that staff availability, delay, market conditions and other factors may make it difficult or impossible to execute transactions at or below desired prices or quantities. Further, there is no guarantee that Company will be able to execute a transaction on behalf of Customer at any price or in any quantity. Company is not liable for any failure to execute an order or transaction on behalf of Customer at the requested prices and/or quantities.
(vi) H edge Limitations. Customer acknowledges and agrees any electricity transactions in connection with this Agreement will not be conducted for the purpose of speculative or proprietary trading. Such transactions will be intended, and designed solely for, the purpose of allowing Customer to manage its retail electricity pricing and quantity risk for each Account. Further, to the extent, if any, that it is determined that this Agreement or any of the transactions under this Agreement, are considered "trade options" by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Company and Customer each represent that it is either a "eligible contract participant" (as defined in Section 1(a) of the Commodity Exchange Act, as amended) or a producer, processor, commercial user of or a merchant handing the commodity or the products or by-products thereof, and each is offering or entering into a commodity option transaction solely for the purposes related to its business as such. Company and Customer confirm to each other that any transaction under this Agreement deemed to be a commodity option transaction is intended to be physically settled so that, if exercised, the option would result in the sale of an exempt commodity for immediate or deferred delivery.
(vii) Customer Decisions. Customer represents and warrants that it will make its own independent decisions authorizing Company to enter into transactions for on behalf of Customer under this Agreement. CUSTOMER ASSUMES ANY AND ALL RISKS ARISING FROM ANY INDEX AND VARIABLE PRICING. Customer is acting for its own account in

determining if any transaction is appropriate for Customer. Customer is making such determinations based upon its own judgment and advice (including any advice Customer may obtain from advisors), all as Customer deems appropriate. Customer agrees and acknowledges that it is not relying, and will not rely upon, communications, information, and/or explanations of any type from Company as investment/savings advice or an endorsement that a specific transaction will have an expected or actual result. No communication of any kind from Company shall be, or constitute any, assurance or guarantee of an expected or actual result. Customer understands and accepts all risks inherent in all transactions conducted under this Agreement. Company is not acting as a fiduciary to Customer with respect to this Agreement. Customer understands, agrees and acknowledges the foregoing representations, warranties and agreements are a material inducement for Company to enter into this Agreement.
(viii) Suspension of Right to Request Hedge Adjustment. Notwithstanding any provision set forth in this Agreement and for the sake of clarity, Company has no obligation to quote or execute any new transactions under this Agreement if Customer is subject to an Event of Default.
