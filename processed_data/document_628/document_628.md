## MASTER ENERGY SALES AGREEMENT

This Master Energy Sales Agreement (the "MSA" or "Master Agreement")"is entered into by and between MP2 Energy LLC, a Shell Energy North America Subsidiary and an authorized agent for its Applicable Licensed Subsidiary in each instance (the Applicable Licensed Subsidiary, the "Seller"), and TEXAS STATE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM, THE ("Customer"). Seller and Customer are sometimes referred to herein individually as a "Party" and collectively as the "Parties."
1.1 Form and Construction of Agreement. The terms of this MSA apply to all end-use sales of Energy by Seller to Customer (each sale a "Transaction"). Each Transaction shall be memorialized with a written confirm executed by the Seller and Customer (each a "Transaction Confirmation" or a "TC"). Each TC will include the commercial terms of the Transaction, including but not limited to the Delivery Period, Contract Price, contract quantities in MWh, costs and EDC Regulatory Charges, Delivery Points and any other special provisions agreed to between the Parties. Customer's execution of a TC shall constitute an offer from Customer to Seller to purchase Energy on the terms set forth in the TC and the MSA. Upon Seller's execution of the TC Seller shall sell, and Customer shall purchase and receive the Total Contract Quantity pursuant to the terms and conditions of this MSA and any applicable TC during the Delivery Period set forth on an applicable TC. Any conflict between the terms and conditions of this Agreement and a TC shall be resolved in favor of the applicable TC. This MSA, associated TC(s), and any amendments, addendums, annexes to either the MSA or a TC set forth the single integrated "Agreement" among the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof, and supersede all prior or contemporaneous agreements and understandings (oral or otherwise) among the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof. The Agreement may only be modified by a written agreement signed by both Parties.
1.2 Term. This MSA commences on the date when the first TC hereunder is executed by both Customer and Seller and continues until terminated in writing by both Parties or terminated under Sections 1.7 and 1.8 hereunder, it being the intent of the Parties that even if the MSA is terminated all Transactions between the Parties will be governed by the terms and conditions set forth in this MSA, as such MSA may be amended in writing from time to time and the termination of this MSA shall in no way release a Party from any obligations existing hereunder or under any effective TC prior to the end of a Delivery Period or Renewal Period. Upon expiration of a Delivery Period unless the Parties have executed a new TC with respect to the Delivery Points, Customer shall continue to purchase and receive the Energy delivered to the Delivery Points at the Hold-Over Rate for successive one-month terms (each a "Renewal Period") until either Party notifies the other Party in writing of its intention to terminate the TC at least twenty (20) days prior to the end of each Renewal Period. Upon timely notice of termination being received by the non-terminating Party, the termination date shall be the next effective drop date after the notice period as permitted by the EDC. The Contract Price during the Renewal Period shall be the Hold-Over Rate set forth on the applicable TC. The terms of this MSA will govern during the Renewal Period(s).
1.3 Title, Risk of Loss and Taxes. Title, liability and risk of loss associated with the Energy purchased and sold hereunder shall pass to Customer at the Delivery Point(s) specified on the applicable TC. Seller is responsible for Taxes arising prior to the Delivery Point and Customer is responsible for Taxes arising at and after the Delivery Point. As an agency of the State of Texas, Customer is exempt from Texas Sales \& Use Tax on goods and services in accordance with Section 151.309 of the Texas Tax Code and Section 3.322 of Title 34 of the Texas Administrative Code. Pursuant to Section 3.322(c)(5) of Title 34 of the Texas Administrative Code, Upon request, Customer shall provide Seller a certificate of exemption.
1.4 Credit. Seller's entry into this MSA and each Transaction is contingent upon Customer, any guarantor or any successor maintaining its creditworthiness during the term of any Transaction and any Renewal Period. If Customer's payment history, credit or financial condition becomes unsatisfactory as determined by Seller in a commercially reasonable manner Seller may request, and Customer shall furnish Seller, Performance Assurance in a form and amount acceptable to Seller within three (3) Business Days of the request. In no event will the amount of the Performance Assurance be more than three (3) times Customer's estimated largest monthly invoice amount.
1.5 Billing and Payment. The method of billing applicable to a Transaction will be as set forth on a TC and will be either Utility Consolidated Billing ("UCB"), Dual Bill Option ("DBO" or "Dual Billing") or Supplier Consolidated Billing ("SBO"). If Customer elects UCB Customer's EDC will invoice Customer monthly for a) the Energy supplied by Seller under this Agreement, b) the EDC Regulatory Charges, and c) any applicable Taxes and payment will be made directly to the EDC by the date specified on the UCB invoice. If Customer elects DBO Customer will instead receive both a monthly invoice from Seller

# Shell <br> ENERGY 

for Energy and a separate monthly invoice from the EDC for EDC Regulatory Charges and Taxes, then following each meter read date, Seller will deliver to Customer an invoice setting forth the charges due for Energy. If available and Customer elects SBO Customer will receive one invoice from Seller for i) Energy supplied by Seller under this Agreement, ii) the EDC Regulatory Charges, and iii) any applicable Taxes and payment will be made directly to Seller by the date specified on the SBO invoice. In the event that Seller does not receive usage data from the EDC, Seller may reasonably estimate Customer's use and such estimate shall be adjusted when the actual consumption is received from the EDC. In the event of SBO or Dual billing, Seller's invoice will be sent via email or mail to Customer. In the case of SBO or DBO the day the invoice is sent is hereafter referred to as the "Sent Date." Payment shall be made by ACH, wire transfer, or check within 30 days of the Sent Date and unless directed otherwise by Seller and as otherwise provided for and in compliance with the Texas Prompt Payment Act. Overdue invoices will accrue interest at the statutory rate referenced for governmental entities in the state in which the Delivery Points are located and as provided for pursuant to the Texas Prompt Payment Act. With respect to all forms of billing and invoices, Customer is responsible for all reasonable costs and fees incurred by Seller in collecting payment. If Customer disputes any amount on an invoice in good faith, Customer will contact Seller promptly in writing, stating the basis for the dispute and shall pay the undisputed amount by the due date; the amount in dispute shall be withheld as provided for pursuant to the Texas Prompt Payment Act until the dispute is resolved. If the amount disputed is determined to be correct, it shall be paid (plus interest accrued under the above calculation method to the extent such interest is permitted by the Texas Prompt Payment Act to be paid) within the timeframe provided for in the Texas Prompt Payment Act.
1.6 Force Majeure. If a Party is unable because of Force Majeure to perform its obligations hereunder and that Party gives notice of the event to the other Party as soon as practicable after its occurrence, then the obligations of the Party affected by the event (other than payment for Energy received and performance of other transactions or other obligations incurred before the Force Majeure event) will be suspended for the duration of the Force Majeure event. "Force Majeure" means a material, unavoidable occurrence beyond a Party's control, but shall not include inability to pay, an increase or decrease in Taxes or the cost of Energy, the economic hardships of a Party, or the full or partial closure of Customer's facilities, unless such closure itself is due to Force Majeure.
1.7 Events of Default. "Default" means any one of the following: (a) the failure by either Party to make, when due, any payment required under the Agreement and such failure is not remedied within five (5) Business Days after written notice; (b) any assignment or general arrangement for the benefit of creditors made by either Party; or the Bankruptcy or Insolvency of either Party or its guarantor; (c) any unauthorized assignment of a Party's rights or obligations hereunder; (d) failure of a Party to provide Performance Assurance pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and such failure is not remedied within five (5) Business Days after written notice; (e) either Party consolidates or merges into or transfers all or substantially all of its assets to another entity and the resulting transferee or surviving entity fails to assume the obligations of such party under the Agreement; (f) Customer switches to another supplier or otherwise terminates a TC after the date Seller accepts a TC and before the Estimated Start Date as indicated on a TC or Customer switches to another supplier or otherwise terminates a TC after the Estimated Start Date and prior to the end of the Delivery Period; (g) Customer fails to receive all of part of the Total Contract Quantity pursuant to a Transaction and such failure is not excused by Seller's failure to perform or by Force Majeure; or (h) any breach of this Agreement by either Party and such breach is not cured within seven (7) Business Days after written notice. If an event of Default listed in subsection (b) above occurs, the Default will be deemed to have automatically occurred just prior to such event.
1.8 Remedies Upon an Event of Default. To the extent permitted by the laws and Constitution of the State of Texas, in the event of a Default, the non-defaulting Party shall have the right to: (a) accelerate any or all amounts owing between the Parties and liquidate and terminate any and all Transactions hereunder and/or this MSA; (b) withhold any payments due to the defaulting Party; (c) immediately suspend performance under this Agreement; and/or (d) calculate an Early Termination Fee ("ETF"). The ETF shall be due from the defaulting Party to the non-defaulting Party within (5) days of written notice of the ETF ("ETF Notice") being delivered by the non-defaulting Party to the defaulting Party. In the case where Customer is the defaulting Party the ETF is the sum of the positive dollar amount obtained by multiplying (i) Contract Price minus the Underlying Value by (ii) the remaining amount of the Total Contract Quantity that would have been delivered under this Agreement had it not been terminated early plus amounts owed for Energy delivered but not paid plus actual fees and expenses incurred by Seller in connection with collecting all amounts due under this Agreement. In the case where Seller is the defaulting Party the ETF is the sum of the net sum of the positive dollar amount obtained by multiplying (i) Underlying Value minus the Contract Price by (ii) the remaining amount of the Total Contract Quantity that would have been delivered under this Agreement had it not been terminated early less amounts owed for Energy delivered, but not paid plus actual fees and expenses incurred by Customer in

connection with collecting all amounts due under this Agreement. The provisions of this section shall be without prejudice and shall be in addition to any right of setoff, combination of accounts, lien or other right to which any Party is at any time otherwise entitled (whether by operation of law, contract or otherwise). If Customer has elected to terminate this Agreement due to Seller's Default such termination shall be rescinded and of no force and effect if Shell Energy North America (US), L.P. (SENA) elects, during the cure period afforded Seller under this Agreement, to cure the Default or to take an assignment of this Agreement and assume Seller's duties and obligations under this Agreement. The Parties agree that the ETF constitutes a reasonable approximation of damages and is not a penalty or punitive in any respect. Seller may, but is not required to, physically liquidate a Transaction or enter into a replacement transaction to determine the ETF.

# 1.9 Limitation of Liability. IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER PARTY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY OR INDIRECT DAMAGES IN TORT, CONTRACT OR OTHERWISE.
