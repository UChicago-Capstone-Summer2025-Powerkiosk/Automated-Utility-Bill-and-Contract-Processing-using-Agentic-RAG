## SECTION 1. TERMS OF SERVICE

1.1 **Purchase and Sale.** ENGIE shall sell and deliver and Customer shall purchase and receive Firm Full Requirements Service. Customer's consumption is not subject to a maximum or minimum usage limit, however Customer may not discontinue electric service prior to the End Date unless due to a sale or closure as set forth in Section 2.5. The electric energy service provided by ENGIE is subject to the acceptance by and eligibility requirements of Customer's local transmission and distribution utility and acceptance and approval by ENGIE based on factors including market fluctuations and Customer's facility(ies) historical usage.

1.2 **Term.** Service shall commence on the first available Utility Transfer Date on or following the Start Date. Service shall remain through the first available Utility Transfer Date following the End Date. Customer's options for service beyond the End Date are: i) executing a new agreement with ENGIE, ii) transferring to another supplier, or iii) providing a written request to ENGIE to transfer service to the default service provider. In the event Customer does not exercise an option prior to the End Date, ENGIE may continue providing post-term service on a month-to-month basis. The price for post-term service shall be a monthly variable rate set by ENGIE plus a post-term charge and any applicable non-utility related charges, ISO charges or administrative fees. Taxes and Utility Related Charges are separately listed in an invoice. Customer may terminate post-term service at any time without liability. The Utility Transfer Date is the date which the utility permits ENGIE to commence or discontinue Customer's service. ENGIE is not responsible or liable for any loss, cost, charge, or fee incurred by or assessed to Customer for a delay in enrollment. Customer understands third parties are, in part, responsible for enrollment timeliness. Customer may request ENGIE offer a "blend and extend" agreement for Customer to benefit from lower rates in exchange for a Term extension.

1.3 **Billing and Payment.** For each Billing Cycle, ENGIE will deliver to Customer an invoice of charges due for the preceding Billing Cycle. ENGIE may use estimated data subject to reconciliation upon receipt of final data. Payment shall be by check or electronic funds transfer (EFT) within 20 days after the date of invoice. For EFT, Customer shall provide account information and authorize ENGIE to collect payment by automatic draft from Customer's bank account. Overdue payments will be charged a 1 1/2 % late fee. ENGIE may report payment history to credit agencies. If an invoice is disputed in good faith, the entire invoice shall be paid when due. Any disputed amounts that are ultimately determined to be owed to Customer shall be repaid by ENGIE. An invoice dispute is waived unless raised within 24 months after the invoice is rendered or an adjustment is made. ENGIE may sell its receivables to the utility pursuant to its purchase of receivables ("POR") program; the terms and conditions of the POR program shall control. When available, ENGIE will use utility consolidated billing (a single bill containing ENGIE and Utility Related Charges).

1.4 **Contract Price.** Customer shall pay the Contract Price per kWh of electric energy consumed in a Billing Cycle. It may include a broker fee and includes non-utility charges including energy, ancillary services, congestion, losses, capacity, and transmission (if applicable). The Contract Price does not include Taxes or Utility Related Charges.

1.5 **Conditions to Transact.** Service may be conditioned upon a credit screen by ENGIE, a review of Customer's recent invoices, verification of a satisfactory credit score, or the requirement that Customer provide credit support such as cash deposit, letter of credit or alternate means of bill payment. Customer consents to the recording of a transaction validation telephone call.

1.6 **Addition or Deletion of Facilities.** Customer may request to add facilities at the Contract Price, or to delete facilities without penalty, up to the point at which consumption volumes, net of all additions or deletions, is not more than 20% above or below Customer's monthly anticipated consumption by zone (the "Add/Delete Band"). Facility addition(s) in excess of the Add/Delete Band may be, at ENGIE's discretion, added at the Contract Price. If not, Customer and ENGIE may agree to a price for the additional volumes. Facility deletion(s) in excess of the Add/Delete Band may be, at ENGIE's discretion, deleted without penalty. If ENGIE does not delete such facility(ies) without penalty, Customer shall pay ENGIE an early Termination Payment within 20 days of notice. The timing of completion for any addition/deletion shall be determined by enrollment/drop rules for the applicable market.

## SECTION 2. GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS

2.1 **Notices.** Notices, correspondence, and address changes (to the contact specified in Section 4) shall be in writing and delivered by post or email and deemed received on the date transmitted or delivered (after business hours received on next Business Day) and notice by overnight mail or courier deemed received 2 Business Days after it was sent.

2.2 **Taxes and Title.** Taxes shall mean any and all taxes and fees imposed on the purchase and sale of electric energy by a governmental authority. Customer will be responsible for, pay, and indemnify ENGIE for all Taxes hereunder, whether imposed on Customer or ENGIE. ENGIE may collect such Taxes from Customer by increasing ENGIE charges for the amount of such Taxes. Title, liability and risk of loss shall pass from ENGIE to Customer at the delivery point.

2.3 **Credit.** If ENGIE has reasonable grounds to believe Customer's creditworthiness or performance under this Agreement has or may become unsatisfactory, ENGIE shall provide Customer with written notice requesting a deposit equal to 3 times the average amount invoiced by Billing Cycle. Upon receipt of notice, Customer shall have 3 Business Days to provide the deposit to ENGIE.

2.4 **Force Majeure.** "Force Majeure" shall mean an event beyond the control of a Party. If either Party is rendered unable by Force Majeure to fulfill obligations, such Party shall give notice and details to the other Party. During a Force Majeure, the obligations of the Parties (other than payments) will be suspended. The Party claiming Force Majeure will make reasonable attempts to remedy the effects and continue performance; This provision shall not be interpreted to require ENGIE to deliver, or Customer to receive, electric energy at other than the delivery point(s). Force Majeure shall not include a decision to shut down, sell, relocate or economic loss.

2.5 **Early Termination / Cancellation.** If Customer cancels this Agreement prior to the Start Date, terminates or discontinues service, switches service to another supplier, or transfers service to the default service provider during the Transaction Term, Customer will be charged an Early Termination Fee equal to the Contract Price less the Current Market Price multiplied by the amount of electric energy supply Customer failed to consume calculated based on historical usage. The Current Market Price is the wholesale price of energy as determined by ENGIE in a commercially reasonable manner. ENGIE may terminate this Agreement if Customer's utility/distribution company removes Customer from the consolidated billing program and requires that ENGIE bill Customer separately for energy supply; or Customer fails to make any payment or deposit when due; or Customer has filed a petition or otherwise commences a proceeding under a bankruptcy law. If ENGIE terminates this Agreement for one of the reasons set forth, Customer will be charged an Early Termination Fee and remain obligated to pay for all electricity received and any interest, fees and penalties incurred by ENGIE.
