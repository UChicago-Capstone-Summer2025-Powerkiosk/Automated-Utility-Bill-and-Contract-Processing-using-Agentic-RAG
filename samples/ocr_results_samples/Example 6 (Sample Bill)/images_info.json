        "description": "The image is a bar and line graph illustrating energy usage and demand from August 2023 to August 2024. The primary components include:\n\n- **Y-Axis (Left):** Represents energy consumption in kilowatt-hours (kWh), ranging from 0 to 25,000.\n- **Y-Axis (Right):** Represents the highest measured demand each month in kilowatts (kW), ranging from 0 to 40.\n- **X-Axis:** Displays months from August 2023 to August 2024.\n\n**Key Elements:**\n- **Orange Bars:** Indicate the total energy used each month. The values for each month are as follows:\n  - August 2023: ~18,750 kWh\n  - September 2023: ~20,000 kWh\n  - October 2023: ~18,750 kWh\n  - November 2023: ~21,250 kWh\n  - December 2023: ~20,000 kWh\n  - January 2024: ~21,250 kWh\n  - February 2024: ~21,250 kWh\n  - March 2024: ~18,750 kWh\n  - April 2024: ~20,000 kWh\n  - May 2024: ~21,250 kWh\n  - June 2024: ~18,750 kWh\n  - July 2024: ~18,750 kWh\n  - August 2024: ~20,000 kWh\n\n- **Gray Line:** Represents the highest measured demand each month, consistently hovering around 30 kW.\n\n- **Legend:**\n  - *Total energy used* is represented by the orange bars.\n  - *Highest Measured Demand each month* is shown by the gray line.\n  - *E Estimated reading* is mentioned but not visually represented in the chart.\n\nOverall, the chart provides a visual comparison of monthly energy usage with the peak demand, indicating a relatively consistent demand throughout the year.",
