Summary : This figure presents the electricity usage history for a customer over a 12-month period, along with comparative statistics for the current and previous year, including average daily use, temperature, billing period length, and total/average usage.

bar chart:
Title & Axes :
  • Title: "Usage History"
  • X-axis: Months (A, S, O, N, D, J, F, M, A, M, J, J, A) representing August through August.
  • Y-axis: Usage (KWH), tick labels at 0, 20,000, 40,000, 60,000, 80,000, 100,000, 120,000.

Data Points :
  • Each bar represents monthly electricity usage in KWH.
  • All months are marked "A" (Actual) for reading type.
  • Usage values (approximate from bar heights):
    - August: ~110,000 KWH
    - September: ~70,000 KWH
    - October: ~60,000 KWH
    - November: ~60,000 KWH
    - December: ~60,000 KWH
    - January: ~70,000 KWH
    - February: ~70,000 KWH
    - March: ~70,000 KWH
    - April: ~80,000 KWH
    - May: ~90,000 KWH
    - June: ~100,000 KWH
    - July: ~110,000 KWH
    - August: ~120,000 KWH

Design Encodings :
  • All bars are the same color (gray).
  • "A" below each bar indicates actual meter readings.
  • No error bars or additional series.

Comparative Statistics Table :
  • Average Daily Use (KWH): Last Year 3079, This Year 3386
  • Average Daily Temperature: Last Year 75, This Year 79
  • Days in Billing Period: Last Year 11, This Year 31
  • Last 12 Months Use (KWH): 968,019
  • Average Monthly Use (KWH): 80,668

Analysis :
  • Usage is highest in August (both years), with a dip in the winter months (October–March), and a steady increase from April through the following August.
  • The average daily use and average monthly use are higher this year compared to last year.
  • The average daily temperature is also higher this year.
  • The billing period for this year is significantly longer (31 days) compared to last year (11 days) for the period shown.
  • The pattern suggests higher electricity consumption during hotter months, likely due to increased cooling needs. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.191,t=0.548,r=0.468,b=0.767), with ID 4daf8715-8b10-4d5e-b8a5-85eaedc632b6 -->

Summary : This figure provides instructions and a template for reporting electric meter readings by telephone or online, showing five analog dial faces for users to replicate their meter's hand positions, and a section for entering digital meter readings.

form template:
Instructions & Purpose :
  • Title: "Provide reading by telephone or on-line only: DO NOT MAIL".
  • Users are instructed to draw hands on the dials exactly as they appear on their electric meter.
  • Guidance: "When reading your meter, if the hand falls between two numbers, always report the lower number."
  • For digital meters, users are to write the numbers in provided boxes.

Dial Faces :
  • Five circular analog dials, each labeled 0–9 in a clockwise or counterclockwise arrangement.
  • Each dial is blank, intended for users to draw the hand positions as seen on their actual meter.
  • Dials are arranged in a single horizontal row.

Digital Meter Section :
  • Text: "If you have a DIGITAL METER write the numbers here:"
  • Five empty square boxes for entering digital meter readings.

Design Encodings :
  • Black-and-white line art.
  • Clear numeric labels on each dial.
  • Bolded instructions for emphasis.

Analysis :
  • The figure is a practical form for utility customers to accurately report their electric meter readings, accommodating both analog and digital meters. The inclusion of explicit instructions and both dial and digital entry options ensures clarity and reduces reporting errors. <!-- figure, from page 1 (l=0.266,t=0.671,r=0.728,b=0.789), with ID 3bcd68cf-2580-459d-8000-66cad3ac9f6d -->

Summary : This image shows a series of horizontal black and white bars of varying thickness, arranged in a vertical stack, resembling a resolution or line-pair test pattern.

test pattern:
# Pattern Overview :
  • The image consists of 9 groups of horizontal black and white stripes.
  • Each group contains several alternating black and white lines.
  • The thickness of the lines increases progressively from top to bottom.

# Stripe Details :
  • Topmost group: Contains the thinnest lines, closely spaced.
  • Middle groups: Lines become progressively thicker and more widely spaced.
  • Bottom group: Contains the thickest lines, with the widest spacing.

# Design Encodings :
  • All lines are perfectly horizontal and parallel.
  • The pattern is monochrome (black and white).
  • No text, numbers, or axis labels are present.

# Analysis :
  • The pattern is consistent with a resolution or sharpness test chart, commonly used to evaluate the resolving power of imaging systems.
  • The gradual increase in line thickness allows for assessment of the system’s ability to distinguish fine detail at different spatial frequencies. <!-- figure, from page 1 (l=0.192,t=0.817,r=0.249,b=0.901), with ID 7dcc9271-43d9-4aad-a620-fa43d5f61694 -->
