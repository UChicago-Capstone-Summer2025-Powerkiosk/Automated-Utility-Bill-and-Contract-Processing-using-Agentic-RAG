table:
Header & Structure :
  • Main header: "Total Amount Due by 02/12/24".
  • Amount due (original): $196.38 (crossed out).
  • Amount due (current): $196.38 (not crossed out, but circled).
  • Sub-rows: "Amount Due On 12/11/23", "Last Payment Received", "Balance Forward", "Total Current Charges".
  • Each sub-row has a corresponding dollar amount.
Data Rows :
  • Amount Due On 12/11/23: $88.12
  • Last Payment Received: $0.00

  • Green header background, white text for main amount due.
  • Blue ink circles around "Total Current Charges: $108.26" and the new total amount due.
  • Strikethrough on the original total amount due ($196.38).
Analysis :
  • The bill shows no payment received since the last statement, so the previous balance ($88.12) is carried forward.
  • The total current charges ($108.26) are added to the balance forward, resulting in the total amount due of $196.38.
  • The use of circles and strikethroughs highlights the updated charges and amount due. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.458,t=0.028,r=0.964,b=0.172), with ID 7a5542b0-c0db-406b-b656-177451a27d61 -->
