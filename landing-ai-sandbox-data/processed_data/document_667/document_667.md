Summary : This bar chart displays the daily electric usage in kilowatt hours (kWh) over a 13-month period, with each bar corresponding to a month and annotated with the average temperature for that month.

bar chart:
Title & Axes :
  • Title: "Electric Usage History - Kilowatt Hours (kWh)".
  • Y-axis: "kWh/Day", ranging from 0 to 500.
  • X-axis: Months from "Jun" to "Jun" (13 months), each labeled with average temperature (°F): Jun 69°, Jul 78°, Aug 78°, Sep 66°, Oct 54°, Nov 47°, Dec 35°, Jan 35°, Feb 38°, Mar 41°, Apr 46°, May 60°, Jun 63°.

Data Points :
  • Each bar represents a month’s average daily electric usage (exact values not labeled, but relative heights visible).
  • The first 12 bars (Jun–May) are gray; the final bar (Jun) is green.
  • The highest usage occurs in August (~480 kWh/day), with other summer months (Jun, Jul, Sep) also high (~420–460 kWh/day).
  • Usage declines through fall and winter, reaching a low in April (~350 kWh/day), then drops sharply in the final June (~230 kWh/day).

Design Encodings :
  • Gray bars for all months except the last, which is green.
  • X-axis labels include both month and average temperature.
  • No gridlines or error bars.

Distribution & Trends :
  • Usage is highest in summer (Jun–Sep), decreases through fall and winter, and is lowest in late spring (Apr–May).
  • The final June (green bar) shows a marked decrease compared to the previous June.

Analysis :
  • Electric usage is strongly seasonal, peaking in the warmest months (likely due to cooling needs) and declining as temperatures drop.
  • The most recent June shows a significant reduction in usage compared to the previous year, despite similar average temperatures, suggesting a possible change in consumption behavior or efficiency improvements. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.045,t=0.180,r=0.424,b=0.439), with ID ba563986-61f6-4b9d-949a-45440b443eb5 -->
