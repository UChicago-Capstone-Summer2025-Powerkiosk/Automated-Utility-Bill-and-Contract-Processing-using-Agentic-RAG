bar chart:
Title & Axes :
  • Title: "Usage History - Total Monthly kWh".
  • X-axis: Months (Dec, Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr, May, Jun, Jul, Aug, Sep, Oct, Nov, Dec).
  • Y-axis: Total Monthly kWh (0 to 350, tick marks at 50-unit intervals).
  • Additional x-axis annotation: "Avg. Temp." with values for each month (Dec: 35°, Jan: 38°, Feb: 35°, Mar: 41°, Apr: 54°, May: 60°, Jun: 68°, Jul: 77°, Aug: 72°, Sep: 67°, Oct: 58°, Nov: 41°, Dec: 40°).

Data Points :
  • Monthly kWh usage (approximate from bar heights):
    – Dec: ~180 kWh
    – Jan: ~250 kWh
    – Feb: ~320 kWh
    – Mar: ~250 kWh
    – Apr: ~80 kWh
    – May: ~50 kWh
    – Jun: ~50 kWh
    – Jul: ~50 kWh
    – Aug: ~50 kWh
    – Sep: ~50 kWh

  • Background is white with a blue title banner.
  • Average temperature values are shown in blue text below the x-axis.

Distribution & Trends :
  • Highest usage occurs in winter months (Dec–Mar).
  • Usage drops sharply in April and remains low from May through November.
  • A slight increase is seen in the final December bar (green).

Analysis :
  • Electricity usage is highest during colder months (Dec–Mar) when average temperatures are lowest (35°–41°), suggesting heating demand.
  • Usage is lowest during warmer months (May–Oct, 54°–77°), indicating reduced need for heating or cooling.
  • The green bar for December may indicate a new billing cycle or a change in reporting, but still shows increased usage compared to preceding months.
  • The pattern demonstrates a strong seasonal effect on electricity consumption, with winter peaks and summer lows. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.038,t=0.225,r=0.420,b=0.457), with ID 61d23704-3f62-4703-a953-ab85ad1d862b -->
