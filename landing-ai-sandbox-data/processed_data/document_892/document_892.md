logo: The image is a logo featuring the acronym "SCG" in green text below three stylized overlapping leaf and droplet shapes—one green (with a leaf vein), one blue, and one orange/yellow—arranged from left to right. The design is centered on a white background.

Analysis : 
• The use of green, blue, and orange/yellow suggests themes of sustainability, water, and energy or environmental stewardship.
• The green leaf with a visible vein emphasizes an eco-friendly or nature-oriented brand identity. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.074,t=0.023,r=0.185,b=0.120), with ID 793c566e-6e2a-41ed-87a8-f3f11470bc91 -->

Summary : This bar chart shows daily usage in CCF per day across each month, likely for a utility such as water or gas, over a one-year period.

bar chart:
Title & Axes :
  • Title: "Daily Usage Chart".
  • Y-axis: "CCF Per Day" with tick labels at 2, 5, 8, 11, 14, 17, 20, 23, 26, 29, 32.
  • X-axis: "MONTHS" with tick labels: O, N, D, J, F, M, A, M, J, J, A, S, O (representing October through October).

Data Points :
  • For each month:
    – O (first): ~5 CCF/day
    – N: ~11 CCF/day
    – D: ~26 CCF/day
    – J: ~29 CCF/day
    – F: ~26 CCF/day
    – M: ~26 CCF/day
    – A: ~20 CCF/day
    – M: ~14 CCF/day
    – J: ~5 CCF/day
    – J: ~2 CCF/day

    – O (last): ~5 CCF/day

Design Encodings :
  • Vertical bars with a hatched fill pattern.
  • No colour; grayscale only.
  • No error bars or additional series.

Distribution & Trends :
  • Usage is lowest in summer months (June, July, August, September).
  • Peaks in winter months (December, January, February, March).
  • Sharp increase from October to December, then a plateau at high usage, followed by a sharp decline after March.

Analysis :
  • The data shows a strong seasonal pattern, with daily usage peaking in winter and dropping to minimal levels in summer. This suggests the usage is likely for heating or a similar seasonal utility. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.733,t=0.630,r=0.965,b=0.799), with ID 2685c985-304d-46f5-a76a-b2fb852c5794 -->
