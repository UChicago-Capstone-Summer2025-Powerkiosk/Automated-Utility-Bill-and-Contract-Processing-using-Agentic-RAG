Summary : This bar chart displays the daily electric usage in kilowatt hours (kWh) over a 13-month period, with each month’s average temperature also shown.

bar chart:

# Title & Axes :
  • Title: “Electric Usage History - Kilowatt Hours (kWh)”.
  • Y-axis: “kWh/Day”, tick marks at 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25.
  • X-axis: Months from “May” to “May” (13 months), each labeled with average temperature (°F): May 64°, Jun 69°, Jul 78°, Aug 78°, Sep 66°, Oct 54°, Nov 47°, Dec 38°, Jan 35°, Feb 41°, Mar 51°, Apr 54°, May 59°.

# Data Points :
  • Each bar represents average daily electric usage (kWh/day) for the month.
  • Heights (approximate, as exact values are not labeled):
    – May (64°): ~13 kWh/day
    – Jun (69°): ~12 kWh/day
    – Jul (78°): ~12 kWh/day
    – Aug (78°): ~12 kWh/day
    – Sep (66°): ~14 kWh/day
    – Oct (54°): ~16 kWh/day
    – Nov (47°): ~18 kWh/day
    – Dec (38°): ~20 kWh/day
    – Jan (35°): ~20 kWh/day
    – Feb (41°): ~19 kWh/day
    – Mar (51°): ~16 kWh/day
    – Apr (54°): ~14 kWh/day
    – May (59°): ~12 kWh/day (green bar)

# Design Encodings :
  • Bars are gray except the last May (59°), which is green.
  • No gridlines or error bars.
  • X-axis labels include both month and average temperature.

# Distribution & Trends :
  • Usage is lowest in summer months (Jun–Aug), rises in fall, peaks in winter (Dec–Jan), then declines in spring.
  • The highest usage occurs in Dec and Jan (~20 kWh/day).
  • The lowest usage is in Jun–Aug (~12 kWh/day).
  • The most recent May (green bar) is slightly lower than the previous May.

# Analysis :
  • Electric usage is inversely related to average temperature: higher in colder months, lower in warmer months.
  • The pattern suggests increased electric usage for heating during winter.
  • The green bar for the most recent May may indicate a change or improvement in usage compared to the previous year. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.045,t=0.180,r=0.424,b=0.439), with ID e44a14a7-cc03-4d6d-807a-3fbf95d4ead0 -->
