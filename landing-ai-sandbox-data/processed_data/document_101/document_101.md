bar chart:

Title & Axes :
  • Title: "CONSUMPTION HISTORY".
  • X-axis: Months (OCT, NOV, DEC, JAN, FEB, MAR, APR, MAY, JUN, JUL, AUG, SEP, OCT).
  • Y-axis: Consumption (units not specified), ranging from 0 to 1,250,000 with tick marks at 0, 312,500, 625,000, 937,500, and 1,250,000.

Data Points :
  • Bars represent monthly consumption values for each month from October (previous year) to October (current year).
  • The current month (October, rightmost bar) is highlighted in a darker blue.
  • Approximate bar heights (in Y-axis units, estimated visually):
    – FEB: ~700,000
    – MAR: ~675,000
    – APR: ~725,000
    – MAY: ~800,000
    – JUN: ~1,050,000 (peak)
    – JUL: ~900,000
    – AUG: ~950,000
    – SEP: ~925,000
    – OCT (current): ~850,000
  • No bars are shown for NOV, DEC, JAN (possibly missing data or zero).

Design Encodings :
  • All bars are light blue except the current month (October), which is dark blue.
  • Horizontal gridlines for easier reading of values.
  • Bolded label for the current month on the X-axis.
  • Note below chart: "Current month's reading is Highlighted."

Distribution & Trends :
  • Consumption is relatively stable from February to May, then peaks sharply in June.
  • After June, consumption decreases but remains higher than earlier months.
  • The current month (October) is lower than the peak but higher than the early months.

Analysis :
  • The data shows a clear seasonal or periodic peak in June, with consumption rising steadily from February, peaking in June, and then declining but staying elevated through October.
  • The current month's consumption is above the early-year values but below the annual maximum.
  • The absence of bars for November, December, and January suggests missing data or no consumption recorded for those months. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.057,t=0.467,r=0.515,b=0.637), with ID a778856a-5c07-4dfd-89fc-f8e5556bc98e -->
