Summary : This bar chart shows the daily electric usage in kilowatt hours (kWh) for each month, along with the corresponding average temperature, over a one-year period.

bar chart:

# Title & Axes :
  • Title: "Electric Usage History – Kilowatt Hours (kWh)"
  • Y-axis: "kWh/Day" (range: 0 to 25, tick marks at 5, 10, 15, 20, 25)
  • X-axis: Months (Dec, Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr, May, Jun, Jul, Aug, Sep, Oct, Nov, Dec) with average temperature for each month (°F): 35°, 38°, 35°, 41°, 54°, 60°, 68°, 72°, 67°, 62°, 41°, 40°

# Data Points :
  • Each bar represents average daily electric usage (kWh) for a month.
  • December (first) ≈ 17 kWh/day
  • January ≈ 20 kWh/day
  • February ≈ 21 kWh/day
  • March ≈ 18 kWh/day
  • April ≈ 12 kWh/day
  • May ≈ 9 kWh/day
  • June ≈ 8 kWh/day
  • July ≈ 10 kWh/day
  • August ≈ 12 kWh/day
  • September ≈ 11 kWh/day
  • October ≈ 9 kWh/day
  • November ≈ 13 kWh/day
  • December (last, green bar) ≈ 19 kWh/day

# Design Encodings :
  • Bars are gray for all months except the last December, which is green.
  • Each bar is labeled below with the month and average temperature.
  • No error bars or additional statistical annotations.

# Distribution & Trends :
  • Highest usage in winter months (Dec–Mar), peaking in February.
  • Lowest usage in late spring and summer (May–July).
  • Usage rises again in late fall and early winter.
  • The last December (green bar) is slightly lower than the February peak but higher than most other months.

# Analysis :
  • Electric usage is highest during colder months (lower average temperatures), suggesting increased heating demand.
  • Usage drops as temperatures rise in spring and summer, indicating less need for heating or cooling.
  • The green bar for the last December may indicate a new or current billing period, or a comparison to previous Decembers.
  • There is a clear inverse relationship between average temperature and electric usage across the year. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.039,t=0.179,r=0.422,b=0.440), with ID 15f5f743-0995-4822-98c5-383067349529 -->

Summary : This image presents a breakdown of current electricity charges, separating the costs for supply and delivery, and includes payment approval markings and supplier contact information.

bar chart:
Title & Axes :
  • No explicit title, but the context is "Current Charges for Electricity".
  • X-axis: Dollar amounts, labeled at $0, $31, $62, $93, $124, $155.
  • No Y-axis; the chart is horizontal and represents cost categories.

Data Points :
  • Supply (blue bar): $44.74, extending from $0 to just under $62.
  • Delivery (green bar): $104.10, extending from just under $62 to just over $155.
  • The bars are contiguous, visually stacking supply and delivery to show total cost.

Design Encodings :
  • Blue bar for "Supply" (cost of electricity from NEXTERA ENERGY SERVICES CONN).
  • Green bar for "Delivery" (cost to deliver electricity from Eversource).
  • Numeric values in large font above each category: $44.74 (Supply), $104.10 (Delivery).
  • Additional text: "Approved For Payment" in red, handwritten signature, circled "MT", and handwritten "P.O. 240486".
  • Supplier contact information is printed in black.

Annotations & Labels :

  • Handwritten signature and notes.
  • Supplier: NEXTERA ENERGY SERVICES CONN, 20455 STATE HIGHWAY 249, HOUSTON TX 77070-2757, 800-882-1276.

Analysis :
  • The delivery charge ($104.10) is more than double the supply charge ($44.74), indicating that the majority of the total electricity bill is due to delivery rather than the cost of electricity itself.
  • The bar chart visually emphasizes the larger proportion of delivery costs.
  • The presence of approval and payment markings suggests this is a processed or reviewed bill. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.455,t=0.181,r=0.961,b=0.570), with ID 20537b1a-eb01-45d6-bdc7-7a97d33e520a -->

Analysis :
  • The supply rate is lowest in winter (Dec–Mar), rises in spring (Apr–Jun), peaks in late summer (Aug), and then stabilizes at an intermediate value in the fall and early winter.
  • The green bar for the final December may indicate a forecast, new rate, or special note. <!-- figure, from page 2 (l=0.038,t=0.162,r=0.417,b=0.368), with ID db4f5283-f81b-4adc-b595-acf5baa0b255 -->

barcode:  
Summary : This image shows a small, square, high-contrast 2D barcode, likely a DataMatrix code, with a dense arrangement of black and white modules.

Barcode Details :  
  • Barcode type: DataMatrix (square, grid-like pattern, no finder patterns typical of QR codes).  
  • Module count: approximately 16 × 16 modules.  
  • Quiet zone: 1–2 modules wide on all sides.  
  • No visible numeric or alphanumeric string within the image.
