Summary : This bar chart shows the electric usage history in kilowatt hours per day (kWh/Day) across each month, with corresponding average temperatures, for a single year.

bar chart:
Title & Axes :
  • Title: "Electric Usage History - Kilowatt Hours (kWh)".
  • Y-axis: "kWh/Day", with tick marks at 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4.
  • X-axis: Months from Dec to Dec, each labeled with average temperature in °F (e.g., Dec 35°, Jan 38°, Feb 35°, Mar 41°, etc.).

Data Points :
  • Each bar represents a month, with the following approximate values (from left to right):
    - Dec (35°): ~0.13 kWh/Day
    - Jan (38°): ~0.35 kWh/Day (highest)
    - Feb (35°): ~0.13 kWh/Day
    - Mar (41°): ~0.13 kWh/Day
    - Apr (49°): ~0.11 kWh/Day
    - May (60°): ~0.09 kWh/Day
    - Jun (68°): ~0.03 kWh/Day (lowest)
    - Jul (72°): ~0.04 kWh/Day
    - Aug (72°): ~0.07 kWh/Day
    - Sep (67°): ~0.09 kWh/Day
    - Oct (58°): ~0.13 kWh/Day
    - Nov (41°): ~0.08 kWh/Day
    - Dec (40°): ~0.12 kWh/Day (highlighted in green)

Design Encodings :
  • Bars are light gray except the final Dec (40°) bar, which is green.
  • X-axis labels include both month and average temperature.
  • No gridlines or error bars are present.

Distribution & Trends :
  • Usage peaks sharply in January (~0.35 kWh/Day).
  • Lowest usage occurs in June (~0.03 kWh/Day).
  • Usage is generally higher in colder months (Dec–Mar, Oct–Dec) and lower in warmer months (May–Sep).
  • The final December bar is highlighted in green, possibly indicating the current or most recent month.

Analysis :
  • Electric usage is highest during the coldest months, especially January, and lowest during the warmest months, suggesting heating is a major driver of electricity consumption.
  • The pattern is U-shaped, with a pronounced dip in summer and peaks in winter.
  • The green bar for the last December may indicate a special status, such as the most recent data point. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.042,t=0.178,r=0.428,b=0.440), with ID bed3702f-0e0c-4efc-ac8b-6eec50cc2710 -->

Summary : This figure presents a breakdown of current electricity charges, separating the cost of supply from the cost of delivery, and visualizes the disparity between these two components using a horizontal bar chart.

bar chart:
# Title & Axes :
  • No explicit chart title; context is "Current Charges for Electricity".
  • X-axis: Dollar amount ($0 to $50, tick marks at $0, $10, $20, $30, $40, $50).
  • Y-axis: Not labeled; single bar represents total delivery cost.
  • No series legend; two categories are described in text: "Supply" and "Delivery".

# Data Points :
  • Supply: $0.31 (cost of electricity from NEXTERA ENERGY SERVICES CONN).
  • Delivery: $44.04 (cost to deliver electricity from Eversource).
  • Bar visually represents the delivery cost, extending to just past $44 on the x-axis; supply cost is not visually represented as a bar.

# Design Encodings :
  • Delivery cost bar is filled in green.
  • Supply and delivery costs are highlighted in blue and green text, respectively.
  • Additional supplier information and approval annotations are present below the chart but are not part of the data visualization.

# Analysis :
  • The delivery cost ($44.04) vastly exceeds the supply cost ($0.31), as visually emphasized by the long green bar for delivery and the near absence of a bar for supply.
  • The figure highlights that the majority of the electricity bill is due to delivery charges rather than the cost of the electricity itself.
  • No trends or distributions are present, as this is a single-period cost breakdown. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.460,t=0.180,r=0.969,b=0.573), with ID 3b2e0d26-6d72-45bc-9a11-bfaad029d551 -->

Summary : This figure provides a summary of electric usage for the current month, including average daily use, year-over-year comparison, and a visual indicator of usage change.

infographic:
Overall Layout :
  • Three main sections: (1) average daily use, (2) year-over-year usage comparison, (3) circular usage change indicator.
  • Blue header labeled "Electric Usage Summary".

Average Daily Use :
  • Text: "This month your average daily use was less than 0.1 kWh".
  • "0.1 kWh" is highlighted in blue.

Year-over-Year Comparison :
  • Text: "This month your usage stayed the same compared to same time last year."

Usage Change Indicator :
  • Large green circle with "0%" in the center.
  • Below "0%", the word "USAGE" and a downward green arrow.

Design Encodings :
  • Blue and green color palette.
  • Key numbers and terms highlighted for emphasis.
  • Circular graphic for visual impact.

Analysis :
  • The household's electric usage is extremely low (less than 0.1 kWh per day).
  • There is no change (0%) in usage compared to the same month last year, as indicated by both text and the green arrow.
  • The visual layout emphasizes stability and minimal consumption. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.045,t=0.445,r=0.427,b=0.565), with ID 491d6db5-02fa-497b-8345-23df0cb806bf -->
