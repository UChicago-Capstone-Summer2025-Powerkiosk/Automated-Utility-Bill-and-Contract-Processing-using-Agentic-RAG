- • POWERLINE SAFETY: Water and electricity don't mix - that's why it's important to be aware of your surroundings and watch out for electrical hazards when working or playing around water recreation areas. Look for overhead power lines before performing activities such as casting a fishing line, using a pool skimming tool or raising a boat mast, and NEVER swim around docks with electrical equipment or boats plugged into shore power. Always keep yourself or any conductive material a minimum of 10 feet away from any power line. Call 1-800-Edson-1 before working near power lines. Learn more at ComEd.com/Safety.
