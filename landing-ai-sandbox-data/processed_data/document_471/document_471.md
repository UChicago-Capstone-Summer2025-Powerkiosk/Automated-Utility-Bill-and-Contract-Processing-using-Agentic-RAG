Summary : This bar chart displays the daily electric usage in kilowatt hours (kWh) over a 13-month period, with each bar corresponding to a month and annotated with the average temperature for that month.

bar chart:
Title & Axes :
  • Title: "Electric Usage History – Kilowatt Hours (kWh)".
  • Y-axis: "kWh/Day", ranging from 0 to 800.
  • X-axis: Months from "Apr" to "Apr" (13 months), each labeled with average temperature in °F (e.g., Apr 47°, May 62°, ..., Apr 43°).

Data Points :
  • Each bar represents a month, with the following approximate values (from left to right):
    – Apr (47°): ~470 kWh/day
    – May (62°): ~500 kWh/day
    – Jun (67°): ~630 kWh/day
    – Jul (74°): ~670 kWh/day
    – Aug (75°): ~680 kWh/day
    – Sep (63°): ~640 kWh/day
    – Oct (51°): ~560 kWh/day
    – Nov (48°): ~490 kWh/day
    – Dec (37°): ~470 kWh/day
    – Jan (31°): ~470 kWh/day
    – Feb (34°): ~470 kWh/day
    – Mar (37°): ~470 kWh/day
    – Apr (43°): ~470 kWh/day (green bar)

Design Encodings :
  • All bars are grey except the last (April, 43°), which is green.
  • Bars are vertical and of equal width.
  • Average temperature for each month is shown below the month label.

Distribution & Trends :
  • Electric usage increases from April, peaking in July and August, then gradually decreases.
  • Usage is relatively stable and lower from November through March.
  • The green bar for the final April matches the lower usage months.

Analysis :
  • Electric usage is highest during the summer months (June–August) when average temperatures are highest.
  • Usage is lowest and stable during the colder months (November–March), despite lower average temperatures.
  • The pattern suggests increased electricity consumption during warmer months, likely due to cooling needs, and relatively steady usage during cooler months. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.045,t=0.180,r=0.425,b=0.438), with ID 34598315-754a-435a-a13e-96d343845b81 -->
