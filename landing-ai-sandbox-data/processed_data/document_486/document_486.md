  • Y-axis: "kWh/Day", ranging from 0 to 500.
  • X-axis: Months from "Apr" to "Apr" (13 months), each labeled with average temperature in °F (e.g., Apr 47°, May 62°, ... Apr 52°).

Data Points :
  • Each bar represents a month, with the following average temperatures:
    - Apr 47°
    - May 62°

Analysis :
  • Electric usage is highest during the summer months (July and August), likely due to increased cooling needs.
  • Usage drops during the cooler months (December to February).
  • The most recent April shows a slight increase compared to the previous months, possibly indicating a seasonal uptick.
  • The color change for the most recent April highlights it for comparison with the previous year. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.045,t=0.180,r=0.425,b=0.439), with ID 0d47fd41-e8e4-4f2f-a870-cc7d548aeab3 -->
