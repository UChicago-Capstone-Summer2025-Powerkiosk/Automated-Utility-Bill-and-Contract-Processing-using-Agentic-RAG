Summary : This bar chart displays the daily electric usage in kilowatt hours (kWh) over a 13-month period, with each bar corresponding to a month and annotated with the average temperature for that month.

bar chart:

# Title & Axes :
  • Title: "Electric Usage History – Kilowatt Hours (kWh)"
  • Y-axis: "kWh/Day", ranging from 0 to 200, with tick marks at 50, 100, 150, and 200.
  • X-axis: Months from "Dec" to "Dec" (13 months), each labeled with the average temperature in °F below the month (e.g., Dec 35°, Jan 35°, Feb 35°, Mar 41°, Apr 51°, May 60°, Jun 68°, Jul 77°, Aug 72°, Sep 67°, Oct 58°, Nov 41°, Dec 40°).

# Data Points :
  • Each bar represents one month’s average daily electric usage (kWh/day).
  • The exact kWh/day values are not numerically labeled, but relative heights show:
    – Higher usage in winter months (Dec, Jan, Feb, Mar, Nov, Dec).
    – Lower usage in late spring and summer (May, Jun, Jul).
    – A peak in September.
  • The final bar (Dec 40°) is colored green, while all others are gray.

# Design Encodings :
  • Bars: Gray for all months except the last (Dec 40°), which is green.
  • X-axis: Each month labeled with both name and average temperature.
  • No gridlines except for Y-axis reference lines.
  • No error bars or statistical annotations.

# Distribution & Trends :
  • Usage is elevated in colder months (Dec–Mar, Nov–Dec), dips in late spring and summer (May–Jul), and rises again in early fall (Sep).
  • The lowest usage appears in May–Jul, corresponding to the highest average temperatures (60°–77°F).
  • The highest usage occurs in months with average temperatures in the 30s and 40s °F.

# Analysis :
  • Electric usage is highest during colder months, suggesting heating demand.
  • Usage drops as temperatures rise, reaching a minimum in the warmest months.
  • There is a secondary peak in September, possibly due to increased cooling or other seasonal factors.
  • The green bar for the final December may indicate a special status (e.g., current month or projected value), but this is not explicitly explained in the chart. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.052,t=0.175,r=0.433,b=0.436), with ID a12f074d-ef50-4c67-9f35-e08c48460213 -->

  • Y-axis: "Max. Demand" (units not specified), tick labels at 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30.
  • X-axis: Months, labeled as Dec, Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr, May, Jun, Jul, Aug, Sep, Oct, Nov, Dec.

Data Points :
  • Single series (grey bars, except last Dec in green):
    – Dec: ~19
    – Jan: ~17
    – Feb: ~12
    – Mar: ~26
    – Apr: ~18
    – May: ~18
    – Jun: ~17
    – Jul: ~20
    – Aug: ~24
    – Sep: ~26
    – Oct: ~25
    – Nov: ~22
    – Dec (green): ~17

Design Encodings :
  • All bars are grey except the final December bar, which is green.
  • No gridlines, error bars, or additional series.

Distribution & Trends :
  • Demand is lowest in February (~12).
  • Highest demand occurs in March and September (~26).
  • Demand is relatively stable from April to July (~17–20).
  • There is a visible increase from July to September, then a slight decrease towards December.

Analysis :
  • The demand profile is variable, with two clear peaks in March and September.
  • The lowest demand is in February.
  • The green bar for the final December may indicate a special status or forecasted value.
  • There is no consistent upward or downward trend across the year; instead, demand fluctuates with notable peaks and troughs. <!-- figure, from page 2 (l=0.047,t=0.391,r=0.435,b=0.570), with ID fc0ec863-905c-4324-9820-59853df13b97 -->

Summary : This image shows a small, square, high-contrast 2D barcode, likely a DataMatrix code, with a number "24" printed below.

barcode:  
Type & Structure :  
  • Barcode type: DataMatrix (square, black-and-white modules, finder pattern on two adjacent sides).  
  • Approximate module count: 10 × 10.  
  • Quiet zone: minimal, 1–2 modules wide.  
  • No visible alphanumeric string within the barcode itself.  

Placement & Context :  
  • The number "24" is centered directly below the barcode, possibly as a label or identifier.  
  • Barcode and number are vertically aligned.  

Analysis :  
  • The barcode is likely used for compact, machine-readable identification or tracking, with the number "24" serving as a human-readable reference. No additional branding or context is visible. <!-- figure, from page 2 (l=0.043,t=0.880,r=0.085,b=0.927), with ID 985144a2-0ec0-473e-b754-51d152550938 -->
