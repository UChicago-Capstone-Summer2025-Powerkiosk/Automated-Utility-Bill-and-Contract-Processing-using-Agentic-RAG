Summary : This bar chart displays daily electric usage in kilowatt hours (kWh) across 13 months, with each bar corresponding to a month and annotated with the average temperature for that month.

bar chart:
Title & Axes :
  • Title: "Electric Usage History – Kilowatt Hours (kWh)".
  • Y-axis: "kWh/Day", tick marks at 0, 200, 400, 600.
  • X-axis: Months from "Apr" to "Apr" (13 months), each labeled with average temperature (°F): Apr 47°, May 62°, Jun 67°, Jul 74°, Aug 75°, Sep 63°, Oct 51°, Nov 43°, Dec 31°, Jan 28°, Feb 31°, Mar 37°, Apr 52°.

Data Points :
  • Each bar represents a month; heights (approximate, as exact values are not labeled) range from just under 500 kWh/day to just over 600 kWh/day.
  • The highest bar is in July (74°), followed by June (67°) and August (75°).
  • The lowest bars are in January (28°) and December (31°).
  • The final bar (April, 52°) is colored green, all others are gray.

Design Encodings :
  • Bars: Gray for all months except the last (April, 52°), which is green.
  • No gridlines or error bars.
  • Average temperature for each month is shown below the month label.

Distribution & Trends :

  • Usage declines from August (75°) through January (28°), reaching a minimum in January.
  • Usage rises again from February (31°) through April (52°).

Analysis :
  • Electric usage is highest during the summer months (June–August) and lowest in winter (December–January), suggesting increased electricity demand during warmer periods, likely due to cooling needs.
  • The green bar for the most recent April (52°) indicates a return to higher usage compared to the previous winter months.
  • There is a clear seasonal pattern, with usage tracking average temperature changes. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.045,t=0.180,r=0.425,b=0.439), with ID 36bd4c90-8f22-47fa-881c-3b06805b2edc -->
