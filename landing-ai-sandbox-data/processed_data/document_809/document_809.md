Summary : This bar chart presents the monthly electric usage history in kilowatt hours (kWh) alongside the average monthly temperature (°F) for a one-year period, allowing comparison of energy consumption with seasonal temperature changes.

bar chart:
Title & Axes :
  • Title: "Electric Usage History in Kilowatt Hours (kWh)".
  • X-axis: Months (from May to the following May), each labeled with the average monthly temperature in °F.
  • Y-axis: Electric usage in kilowatt hours (kWh), with values shown above each bar.

Data Points :
  • May (58°): 2080 kWh
  • Jun (72°): 1920 kWh
  • Jul (74°): 1920 kWh
  • Aug (76°): 1760 kWh
  • Sep (75°): 1920 kWh
  • Oct (66°): 1760 kWh
  • Nov (47°): 2080 kWh
  • Dec (39°): 2240 kWh
  • Jan (29°): 2240 kWh
  • Feb (24°): 1440 kWh
  • Mar (39°): 1600 kWh
  • Apr (44°): 1440 kWh
  • May (63°): 1280 kWh

Design Encodings :
  • Each month is represented by a vertical bar; all bars are light blue except the final May bar, which is a darker blue.
  • Average monthly temperature is shown below each month as a small number with a degree symbol.
  • Usage values are displayed numerically above each bar.

Distribution & Trends :
  • Electric usage is highest in December and January (2240 kWh each).
  • Usage is also relatively high in the summer months (May–September), with values ranging from 1760 to 2080 kWh.
  • The lowest usage occurs in the final May (1280 kWh), with other low points in February (1440 kWh), March (1600 kWh), and April (1440 kWh).
  • Temperatures are highest in July, August, and September (74°–76°), and lowest in January and February (29°, 24°).

Analysis :
  • Electric usage peaks during the coldest months (December and January), suggesting increased heating demand.
  • There is a secondary, less pronounced peak in the warmer months (May–September), likely due to cooling needs.
  • Usage drops in the milder months (April, May, October), corresponding to moderate temperatures.
  • The pattern indicates a strong seasonal relationship between temperature extremes and higher electric consumption. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.032,t=0.334,r=0.612,b=0.460), with ID ccaab22d-761f-4528-bf5e-6b386db26a98 -->

  • FEB (24°): 925 therms
  • MAR (39°): 357 therms
  • APR (45°): 190 therms
  • MAY (63°): 18 therms

Design Encodings :
  • Bars are light blue.
  • Each bar is labeled with its exact value above.
  • Average monthly temperature is shown below each month in smaller text.

Distribution & Trends :
  • Gas usage is lowest (0–16 therms) from June through October, when temperatures are highest (66–76°F).
  • Usage rises sharply in November (575 therms) as temperatures drop (46°F), peaking in January (1200 therms, 29°F).
  • After January, usage declines as temperatures rise, with a secondary peak in February (925 therms, 24°F).
  • Usage remains elevated through March (357 therms, 39°F) and April (190 therms, 45°F), then drops again in May (18 therms, 63°F).

Analysis :
  • Gas usage is strongly inversely correlated with average monthly temperature: highest in the coldest months (December–February) and lowest in the warmest months (June–September).
  • The most pronounced peak occurs in January, coinciding with the lowest average temperature.
  • There is a clear seasonal pattern, with minimal gas usage during summer and a sharp increase as temperatures fall in late autumn and winter. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.033,t=0.467,r=0.613,b=0.594), with ID e38323ce-b773-4205-a612-a21a7e3efa80 -->

Summary : This image is a small, square, high-contrast black-and-white pattern composed of a grid of filled and empty squares, characteristic of a 2D barcode.

barcode:  
Type & Structure :  
  • Barcode type: DataMatrix (square, grid-based, no visible numeric or alphanumeric string).

Summary : This image is a small, square, high-contrast black-and-white pattern with a dense arrangement of modules, characteristic of a 2D barcode.

barcode:  
Type & Structure :  
  • Appears to be a DataMatrix code (square, grid-like, with finder patterns on two adjacent sides).  
  • Approximate module count: 16 × 16.  
  • Quiet zone: 1 module wide on all sides.  

Content :  
  • Encoded alphanumeric string: not human-readable from the image.  
  • No visible numeric or text string adjacent to the code.  

Placement & Dimensions :  
  • Square aspect ratio, no visible border or label.  
  • No additional design elements, logos, or colour—pure black and white.  

Analysis :  
  • The barcode is likely intended for compact, high-density data storage (e.g., serial numbers, URLs, or product IDs).  
  • No branding or contextual clues are present in the image. <!-- figure, from page 2 (l=0.906,t=0.601,r=0.954,b=0.641), with ID 7c3ff57a-0420-46a1-be28-8bb987691a05 -->

logo: Ameren Illinois

Visible Text and Design :
  • The logo consists of the word "Ameren" in bold black italic font, with "ILLINOIS" in uppercase gray letters below it.
  • To the left of the text is a circular green graphic composed of radiating segments, with one segment in red, suggesting motion or energy.

Dimensions and Placement :
  • The graphic is positioned to the left of the text.
  • "Ameren" is the primary text, with "ILLINOIS" smaller and beneath it.

Analysis :
  • The use of green and a radiating design element suggests themes of energy, sustainability, or power distribution.
  • The red segment may indicate a focal point or highlight within the energy motif.
  • The logo clearly identifies the company as Ameren Illinois, likely an energy or utility provider. <!-- figure, from page 3 (l=0.031,t=0.013,r=0.184,b=0.081), with ID 3c8e206b-e8e2-4192-b47a-207ca92807a5 -->

Summary : This image shows two social media icons, representing Facebook and Twitter, in a simple monochrome style.

logo:  
Scene Overview : 
  • The image contains two distinct logos: the Facebook "f" and the Twitter bird.  
  • Both icons are rendered in a solid grey color on a white background.  
  • The Facebook icon is on the left, and the Twitter icon is on the right, with some space between them.  
Technical Details : 
  • No text, taglines, or additional branding elements are present.  
  • The icons are shown without any surrounding UI or interactive elements.  
Spatial Relationships : 
  • The two logos are horizontally aligned and evenly spaced.  
  • Both icons are of similar size and visual weight.  
Analysis : 
  • The use of grey suggests a neutral or inactive state, possibly indicating disabled or unselected social media sharing options. <!-- figure, from page 3 (l=0.270,t=0.035,r=0.319,b=0.059), with ID dcf5f8c1-d78f-4f3e-a6ca-9e31a54e3969 -->
