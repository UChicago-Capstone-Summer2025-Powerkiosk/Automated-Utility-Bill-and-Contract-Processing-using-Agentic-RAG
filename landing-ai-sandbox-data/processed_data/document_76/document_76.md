Summary : This bar chart displays the total kilowatt-hour (kWh) usage over a 13-month period, showing monthly energy consumption trends.

bar chart:
Title & Axes :
  • Title: "Your Usage Profile 13-Month Usage (Total kWh)".
  • X-axis: Months, labeled as A, S, O, N, D, J, F, M, A, M, J, J, A (likely August through August).
  • Y-axis: Total kWh, with tick marks at 0, 38410, and 76820.

Data Points :
  • Each bar represents total kWh usage for a given month.
  • Highest bars: first A (August) and last A (August), both near 76820 kWh.
  • Lowest bars: D (December), J (January), F (February), M (March), all near or just above 38410 kWh.
  • Middle months (S, O, N, A, M, J, J) show intermediate values, with a gradual increase from spring to summer.

Design Encodings :
  • All bars are solid black.
  • No gridlines, error bars, or additional series.
  • Light gray background.

Distribution & Trends :
  • U-shaped pattern: high usage in late summer/early fall, decreasing through winter, then rising again in late spring and summer.
  • Lowest usage occurs in winter months.
  • Usage increases sharply in the last three months (J, J, A).

Analysis :
  • The data shows a clear seasonal trend, with energy usage peaking in the summer months (likely due to cooling) and reaching a minimum in winter (possibly due to reduced cooling or heating needs).
  • The pattern suggests significant seasonal variation in energy consumption, with the highest demand in August and the lowest in winter months. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.056,t=0.241,r=0.283,b=0.364), with ID d7cb5f64-0627-464e-af23-93cd6cd0d0b8 -->

barcode:
Barcode Details :
  • Barcode type: Not explicitly labeled; appears to be a 1D linear barcode (exact symbology not specified).
  • Visible content: No full numeric or alphanumeric string is visible; only the partial text "CONVER" appears below the barcode.
  • Approximate module count: Approximately 60–70 bars (modules) visible.
  • Quiet zone: Present on both left and right edges (white space before and after the bars).
  • Dimensions: The barcode is horizontally oriented, with a height approximately 4 times the height of the text "CONVER" below it.

Placement & Context :
  • The barcode is positioned above the partial text "CONVER".
  • No additional labels, numbers, or context are visible in the crop.

Analysis :
  • The barcode is likely intended for machine-readable identification, but the absence of a visible numeric or alphanumeric string prevents manual decoding.
  • The presence of the partial text "CONVER" may indicate a product or category name associated with the barcode. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.157,t=0.838,r=0.490,b=0.862), with ID 541e234b-fb0e-439d-ad0c-1ee9c41e6eb9 -->
