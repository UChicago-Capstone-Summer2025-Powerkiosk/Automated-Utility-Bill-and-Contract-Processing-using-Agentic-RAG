Summary : This bar chart displays the daily electric usage in kilowatt hours (kWh) for each month, along with the corresponding average temperature, over a one-year period.

bar chart:

# Title & Axes :
  • Title: "Electric Usage History – Kilowatt Hours (kWh)"
  • Y-axis: "kWh/Day", with tick marks at 0, 0.05, 0.10, 0.15, 0.20.
  • X-axis: Months from "Dec" to "Dec" (13 bars), each labeled with the average temperature in °F below (e.g., Dec 35°, Jan 35°, Feb 35°, Mar 41°, Apr 48°, May 60°, Jun 68°, Jul 77°, Aug 72°, Sep 67°, Oct 56°, Nov 41°, Dec 40°).

# Data Points :
  • Each bar represents one month’s average daily electric usage (kWh/day).
  • The heights of the bars range from just above 0.10 to just below 0.17 kWh/day.
  • The December bar at the far right is highlighted in green; all other bars are grey.
  • Average temperatures for each month (in °F): Dec 35°, Jan 35°, Feb 35°, Mar 41°, Apr 48°, May 60°, Jun 68°, Jul 77°, Aug 72°, Sep 67°, Oct 56°, Nov 41°, Dec 40°.

# Design Encodings :
  • Bars: Grey for all months except the last December, which is green.
  • No gridlines or error bars.
  • X-axis labels include both month and average temperature.
  • Y-axis uses a linear scale.

# Distribution & Trends :
  • Electric usage per day fluctuates monthly, with no single clear upward or downward trend.
  • The lowest bars appear in March, April, and November.
  • The highest bars are in February, May, September, and October.
  • The green December bar is similar in height to the higher-usage months.

# Analysis :
  • Electric usage per day does not strictly correlate with average temperature; both colder and milder months show higher and lower usage.
  • The green bar for December (40°F) is highlighted, possibly to indicate the most recent data or a comparison point.
  • There is moderate variability in usage across the year, with no extreme outliers.
  • Usage appears slightly elevated in months with both lower and higher average temperatures, suggesting factors beyond temperature may influence electric consumption. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.050,t=0.176,r=0.432,b=0.437), with ID dd27e29a-c7b6-47c0-a676-bf860d017fd5 -->

Summary : This figure presents a breakdown of current electricity charges, separating the cost of supply from the cost of delivery, with a bar chart visualizing the relative amounts. It also includes supplier contact information and handwritten approval details.

bar chart:
Title & Axes :
  • No explicit title; context is "Current Charges for Electricity".
  • X-axis: Dollar amount ($0 to $50), labeled with tick marks at $0, $10, $20, $30, $40, $50.
  • Y-axis: Not labeled; only a single bar is shown.

Data Points :
  • Supply: $0.39 (cost of electricity from NEXTERA ENERGY SERVICES CONN).
  • Delivery: $44.05 (cost to deliver electricity from Eversource).
  • Bar chart visually represents the delivery charge as a long green bar extending to just past $44, while the supply charge is too small to be visible on the same scale.

Design Encodings :
  • "Supply" in blue text, "Delivery" in green text.
  • Bar is green, corresponding to the delivery charge.
  • No gridlines or additional series.

Supplier & Approval Details :
  • Electric supplier: NEXTERA ENERGY SERVICES CONN, 20455 STATE HIGHWAY 249, HOUSTON TX 77070-2757, 800-882-1276.
  • Handwritten approval: Signature, date "12/27/2023", account #, and P.O. # "240115" in blue ink.

Analysis :
  • The delivery charge ($44.05) vastly exceeds the supply charge ($0.39), as visually emphasized by the bar chart.
  • The supply cost is almost negligible compared to the delivery cost.
  • The figure highlights the disproportionate contribution of delivery fees to the total electricity bill. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.465,t=0.181,r=0.967,b=0.562), with ID b01603ee-ffeb-44be-aa8b-2c9898efeb80 -->
