# Title & Axes :
  • Title: "Gas Usage History in Therms"
  • X-axis: Months (MAY, JUN, JUL, AUG, SEP, OCT, NOV, DEC, JAN, FEB, MAR, APR, MAY)
  • Y-axis: Gas usage in therms (values shown above each bar; no explicit axis label visible)
  • Additional data: Average monthly temperature (°F) shown below each month

# Data Points :
  • MAY (58°): 3399 therms
  • JUN (72°): 629 therms
  • JUL (74°): 220 therms
  • AUG (76°): 149 therms
  • SEP (75°): 201 therms
  • OCT (66°): 521 therms
  • NOV (47°): 3991 therms
  • DEC (39°): 8879 therms
  • JAN (29°): 10790 therms
  • FEB (24°): 12092 therms
  • MAR (39°): 8173 therms
  • APR (44°): 5954 therms
  • MAY (63°): 3184 therms

# Design Encodings :
  • Bars are light blue, with each bar labeled with its exact therm value above.
  • Average monthly temperature is shown as a number with a degree symbol below each month.
  • No gridlines or error bars are present.

# Distribution & Trends :
  • Gas usage is lowest from June through September (summer months, highest temperatures).
  • Usage begins to rise in October, peaking from December through March (coldest months).
  • The highest usage is in February (12092 therms, 24°F).
  • Usage declines again in April and May as temperatures rise.

# Analysis :
  • There is a clear inverse relationship between average monthly temperature and gas usage: as temperatures decrease, gas usage increases, peaking in the coldest months (December–March).
  • The lowest gas usage occurs during the warmest months (June–September).
  • The pattern suggests gas is primarily used for heating, with demand rising sharply in winter and falling in summer.
  • The data for May is shown twice, likely representing two different years. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.031,t=0.466,r=0.613,b=0.592), with ID b62ce19d-b2b6-4533-adc6-3ccaed46ceda -->

Summary : This image shows two social media platform logos, Facebook and Twitter, in grayscale, side by side.

logo:  
Logos & Elements : 
  • Facebook logo: stylized lowercase "f" in a square, rendered in gray.
  • Twitter logo: stylized bird silhouette facing right, also in gray.
  • Both logos are presented without any accompanying text or tagline.
  • The logos are horizontally aligned with some white space between them.

Technical Details : 
  • No additional text, company names, or taglines are visible.
  • The logos are in grayscale, not their usual brand colours (blue for Facebook, blue for Twitter).
  • No background elements, borders, or other design features are present.

Spatial Relationships : 
  • Facebook logo is on the left, Twitter logo is on the right.

Summary : This image shows two social media icons, Facebook and Twitter, in grayscale, side by side on a white background.

logo: Facebook and Twitter icons
Scene Overview : 
  • The image contains two distinct social media logos: the Facebook "f" and the Twitter bird.
  • Both icons are rendered in a medium gray color.
  • The icons are horizontally aligned, with Facebook on the left and Twitter on the right.
  • The background is plain white, with no additional text or design elements.

Technical Details : 
  • No text other than the stylized "f" and bird shapes.
  • No scale bar or size reference is present.
  • No company names or taglines are visible.

Spatial Relationships : 
  • The Facebook icon is positioned to the left of the Twitter icon, with a small gap between them.
  • Both icons are of similar size and visual weight.

Analysis : 
  • The use of grayscale rather than brand colors suggests a neutral or inactive state, possibly for a website footer or a print context where color is not used.
  • The pairing of these two icons indicates a reference to social media sharing or links. <!-- figure, from page 5 (l=0.270,t=0.035,r=0.320,b=0.058), with ID b0e69ebe-046b-4338-ad35-13a0eda750fb -->
