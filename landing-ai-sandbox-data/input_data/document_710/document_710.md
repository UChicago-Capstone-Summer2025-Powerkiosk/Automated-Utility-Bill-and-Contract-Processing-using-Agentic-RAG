logo: WestPenn Power, A FirstEnergy Company

Visible Text :
  • "WestPenn Power" in large, bold font, with "West" and "Penn" joined together and "Power" below, slightly offset.
  • Tagline below: "A FirstEnergy Company" in smaller font, with a sweeping underline graphic.

Design & Layout :
  • Black text on white background.
  • "WestPenn Power" is the dominant element, with "Power" underlined by a thick, swooping line that extends from left to right.
  • The tagline is positioned below the underline, aligned left.

Analysis :
