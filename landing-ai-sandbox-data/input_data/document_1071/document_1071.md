barcode:
  Barcode Details :
    • No visible numeric or alphanumeric string below or above the bars.
    • Barcode type not explicitly labeled; appears to be a 1D linear barcode (possibly Code 128 or similar).
    • Approximate module count: about 70–80 bars (modules) in total.
    • Quiet zones (blank space) present at both left and right ends.
    • No additional text, numbers, or graphical elements present.
    • Black bars on a white background; horizontal orientation.
