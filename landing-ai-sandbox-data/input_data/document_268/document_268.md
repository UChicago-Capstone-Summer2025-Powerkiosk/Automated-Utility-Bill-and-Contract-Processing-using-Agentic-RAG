  • Low, stable usage (~4 kWh/day) from June through November.
  • Slight increase in the final December (~5 kWh/day).

# Analysis :
  • Electric usage is highest during the coldest months (December–February), suggesting heating demand.
  • There is a pronounced drop in usage as temperatures rise in spring, with a brief secondary peak in May.
  • Usage remains low and stable through the warmer months (June–November), indicating reduced need for heating or cooling.
  • The green bar for the final December may indicate a new or projected value, slightly higher than the preceding months but much lower than the previous December. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.040,t=0.177,r=0.428,b=0.443), with ID 5d1c350b-25a3-42a8-aa79-447945b7ed93 -->

Summary : This visual breaks down the current electricity charges into two main components: supply and delivery, showing their respective costs and proportions for a billing period.

bar chart:
Title & Axes :
  • No explicit title, but the content is "Current Charges for Electricity".
  • X-axis: Dollar amounts ($0, $12, $24, $36, $48, $60).
  • Y-axis: Not labeled; represents the cost components (supply and delivery).

Data Points :
  • Supply (blue): $5.32 (cost of electricity from NEXTERA ENERGY SERVICES CONN).
  • Delivery (green): $44.77 (cost to deliver electricity from Eversource).

Design Encodings :
  • Blue bar segment for supply, green bar segment for delivery.
  • Bar segments are stacked horizontally, with supply as a small initial segment and delivery as a much larger segment.
  • Numeric values are shown in large font above each segment: "$5.32" in blue, "$44.77" in green.
  • Additional text: "Approved For Payment" in red, handwritten signature, and supplier contact information.

Distribution & Trends :
  • The delivery charge ($44.77) is much larger than the supply charge ($5.32).
  • The total bar length visually emphasizes the dominance of delivery costs in the total bill.

Analysis :
  • The delivery cost constitutes the vast majority of the total electricity charge, with supply making up only a small fraction.
  • The visual highlights the disproportionate contribution of delivery fees compared to the actual electricity supply cost.
  • The chart is designed to make the cost structure transparent to the customer, with clear supplier information and payment approval annotation. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.456,t=0.177,r=0.968,b=0.564), with ID 8303edaf-f91b-46ba-a3c3-eaae43b4637a -->

Design Details :  
  • Black modules on a white background.  
  • L-shaped solid border on two adjacent sides (DataMatrix finder pattern).  
  • Alternating pattern on the other two sides (timing pattern).  

Analysis :  
  • This is a generic DataMatrix barcode, commonly used for encoding short strings or identifiers in a compact space. No content is visually readable from the image alone. <!-- figure, from page 2 (l=0.034,t=0.885,r=0.076,b=0.922), with ID 15fca06d-e5ce-4d9b-99af-9fa3fd41245b -->
