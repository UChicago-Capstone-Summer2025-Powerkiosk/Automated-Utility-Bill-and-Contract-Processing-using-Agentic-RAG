Responsibility for gas piping. The customer is responsible for the maintenance of all gas piping from the gas meter to all gas appliances. Buried gas piping that is not maintained is subjected to potential hazards of corrosion and leakage. For your safety, all buried gas piping should be periodically inspected for leaks. If the buried piping is metallic, it should also be periodically inspected for corrosion. If an unsafe condition is found, the gas piping will need to be promptly repaired. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.362,t=0.319,r=0.950,b=0.387), with ID 7902ad93-3656-48cd-833d-9751493d5352 -->

When digging near buried gas piping, the piping must be located in advance and digging should be done by hand. Plumbing and heating contractors can assist in locating, inspecting and repairing customers' buried pipelines. State law requires that you must call at least two (2) full working days before you dig. Always call 811 before you dig. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.363,t=0.389,r=0.947,b=0.446), with ID dc9a62c7-e286-4d5f-adf8-571463c3173d -->

Summary : This is a public safety awareness poster encouraging people to call 811 before starting any digging project, regardless of depth.

photo:  
Scene Overview : 
  • The main subject is a person wearing a wide-brimmed hat, blue shirt, and green gardening gloves, holding a small gardening trowel and a plant with exposed roots.
  • The perspective is from below ground, looking up through a circular hole in the soil toward the person.
  • The background is bright, suggesting daylight, with a soft focus on the sky and some foliage.
  • The top of the image contains the text: "Think your digging project is too shallow to matter?"
  • The bottom of the image features a prominent "811" logo with a shovel graphic.

Technical Details : 
  • No scale bar or magnification.
  • The image uses natural lighting and a color palette dominated by earth tones, green, and blue.
  • The 811 logo is in yellow and black with a stylized shovel.

Spatial Relationships : 
  • The person is centered in the circular opening, with the trowel and plant extending toward the viewer.
  • The soil forms a dark border around the circular opening, creating a tunnel-vision effect.

Analysis : 
  • The visual message emphasizes the importance of safety and awareness when digging, regardless of project size, by showing a typical gardening scenario and highlighting the 811 call-before-you-dig service. <!-- figure, from page 2 (l=0.059,t=0.101,r=0.491,b=0.476), with ID 56dc83a4-cabb-4e5e-9345-f2daf15bcc79 -->

Summary : This image is a QR code, a type of two-dimensional barcode, containing encoded information. The code features a central blue circle with a white horizontal line, possibly a logo or branding element, partially obscuring the code pattern.

barcode:  
Type & Structure :  
  • QR code (square, black-and-white modules on white background).  
  • Central blue circle with a white horizontal line, likely a logo or branding mark, partially covering the code.  
  • Standard QR code finder patterns in three corners.  
  • Approximate module count: 29 × 29.  
  • Quiet zone (white border) present on all sides.

Content & Readability :  
  • Encoded data is not human-readable from the image.  
  • Central logo may interfere with some QR code readers, but most modern readers can compensate.

Design Encodings :  
  • Black modules on white background.  
  • Blue circle with white horizontal line as central overlay.

Dimensions & Placement :  
  • Square aspect ratio.  
  • Logo is centered within the QR code.

Analysis :  
  • The QR code is designed for digital scanning, likely to direct users to a website or digital content.  
  • The central logo suggests branding or organizational identity, but the exact entity is not specified in the image.  
  • The presence of the logo may slightly reduce scan reliability but is a common practice for branded QR codes. <!-- figure, from page 2 (l=0.819,t=0.561,r=0.938,b=0.651), with ID c6217deb-071e-49da-99a0-6e88486f923a -->

Carbon monoxide (CO) safety is crucial because CO is a colorless, odorless gas that can be deadly when inhaled in high concentrations.

Symptoms of exposure: Exposure to carbon monoxide can lead to symptoms such as headaches, dizziness, nausea, confusion and even loss of consciousness. Prolonged exposure can be fatal.

Early warning devices: Install and/or test the carbon monoxide detectors in your home. These devices can alert you to the presence of carbon monoxide before it reaches dangerous levels.

Ventilation: Make sure all combustion appliances are adequately maintained and properly vented according to manufacturer's specifications. This includes gas stoves, fireplaces, furnaces and water heaters.

Summary : This instructional figure explains how to read a typical four-dial utility meter, showing the correct method for interpreting the numbers indicated by the pointer positions on each dial.

diagram:
Dials & Labels :
  • Four circular dials are shown, each labeled with a place value: "1,000,000", "100,000", "10,000", and "1,000".
  • Each dial has numbers 0–9 arranged around the circumference.
  • Each dial has a curved arrow indicating the direction of pointer movement (clockwise or counterclockwise).
  • Each dial has a black pointer indicating a specific number.

Pointer Positions :
  • "1,000,000" dial: pointer is between 6 and 7, closer to 7.
  • "100,000" dial: pointer is between 8 and 9, closer to 9.
  • "10,000" dial: pointer is between 3 and 4, closer to 4.
  • "1,000" dial: pointer is between 6 and 7, closer to 7.

Instructions (excerpted from image) :
  • Read the dials from right to left.
  • For each dial, record the last number the pointer passed (not the next number it is approaching).
  • The example specifically notes reading the "thousand-foot" dial as 7.

Design Encodings :
  • Curved arrows on each dial indicate the direction in which the pointer moves (alternating directions).
  • Bold black pointers for clarity.
  • Place value labels above each dial.

Analysis :
  • The figure visually clarifies the correct method for reading multi-dial utility meters, emphasizing the importance of reading the number the pointer has just passed, not the one it is approaching.
  • The alternating direction of dial movement is highlighted by the curved arrows, which is a common feature in such meters to prevent mechanical errors.
  • The example demonstrates that careful attention to pointer position and dial direction is necessary for accurate meter reading. <!-- figure, from page 3 (l=0.056,t=0.810,r=0.476,b=0.969), with ID f0bb1c59-7fb7-4926-9f32-ed7c8ba3ffda -->

counterclockwise direction. The pointer is near the 9, but to be sure whether to read it as that
number or the lower number 8, the previously mentioned "same or lower number rule" must be
applied. Since the pointer in the "thousand-foot" dial to the right is nearer the 8 and the pointer
has not reached the 0, the "10-thousand" dial should be read as 8. <!-- text, from page 3 (l=0.520,t=0.813,r=0.962,b=0.861), with ID 20f693fa-bc5c-41ba-bd48-db92e89c33bc -->

3. Read the "100-thousand" dial, it seems to point to 2. Double-check by using the rule above. Since the pointer of the "10-thousand" dial is between 8 and 9, take the lower reading number, 1, for the "100-thousand" dial. <!-- text, from page 3 (l=0.519,t=0.862,r=0.962,b=0.900), with ID ee5a70ce-cd97-47b4-a0d4-a7b0231143f2 -->

4. Read the left-most dial, the "million-foot" dial. The pointer is near the 6. Using the "same or lower number rule", we find the pointer on the dial to the right is between 1 and 2, so we read the "million-foot" dial exactly as the number it is on or near, 6. <!-- text, from page 3 (l=0.519,t=0.901,r=0.964,b=0.939), with ID 153ec302-54e1-417e-bc52-66c0753b183b -->

The entire meter reading is 6187. <!-- marginalia, from page 3 (l=0.521,t=0.940,r=0.675,b=0.955), with ID 341f2ee6-99b5-425e-b2f7-d2f6e8e23b00 -->
