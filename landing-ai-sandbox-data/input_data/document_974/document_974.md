Routine maintenance improves reliability.

BGE’s commitment to electricity reliability goes beyond maintaining just the poles and lines — it extends to the trees surrounding more than 10,000 miles of overhead power lines. BGE invests more than $34 million each year into our Tree and Vegetation Management Program, which includes assessing, pruning and removing trees that may cause electric outages, as well as managing vegetation above our underground natural gas transmission pipeline network. <!-- text, from page 4 (l=0.052,t=0.217,r=0.874,b=0.340), with ID 5057b809-0fd5-4850-a481-81e78efe5437 -->

All of this attention to trees has reduced tree-related service outages by nearly 40% since 2011. To learn more about how smart energy gets more reliable every day, visit BGE.COM/Reliability. <!-- text, from page 4 (l=0.053,t=0.345,r=0.879,b=0.383), with ID 3a7751e7-d0ad-4e5e-a93f-ed14a8f50922 -->

SCHEDULED MAINTENANCE  
BGE’s strategy is based on a four- or five-year trimming cycle, routine inspections and reliability performance data. BGE also further enhances tree and vegetation management efforts by implementing requirements mandated by the Maryland Public Service Commission, called the Electricity Service Quality and Reliability Act or RM 43 standards. <!-- text, from page 4 (l=0.053,t=0.664,r=0.564,b=0.771), with ID 965d7086-1a29-48c5-8d15-cb4c35778027 -->

PRUNING STANDARDS  
BGE uses only licensed, utility-qualified, professional tree-trimming contractors to manage the trees and other vegetation around power lines and equipment. When a neighborhood is scheduled for routine tree and vegetation management work, BGE’s contractors place door hangers to let property owners know when to expect crews. If heavy tree pruning or removal is required, the property owner will be directly contacted before work is commenced. If you have questions about the proposed work, call the BGE contractor directly by using the phone number on the door hanger. To learn more information on the program, visit **BGE.COM/TreeCare**. <!-- text, from page 4 (l=0.053,t=0.780,r=0.595,b=0.960), with ID 229f2ca7-fd3c-4dc3-8633-e29194aeee3f -->

TREE TRIMMING

BGE encourages customers to manage the heights or spreads of their trees before they get within 10 feet of interfering with electrical lines and equipment. In addition, the Maryland High Voltage Line Act (HVLA) requires anyone working or using tools or equipment within 10 feet of overhead lines to contact BGE first at 800.685.0123, to evaluate the site and plan how to best make the work area safe. To find a private licensed tree care contractor to prune or remove your trees, visit BGE.COM/TreeCare. <!-- text, from page 5 (l=0.051,t=0.040,r=0.903,b=0.169), with ID 5cabbb6a-9dff-458e-a7b8-4a6580ea36b1 -->

Summary : This photo shows a person in red rubber boots using a shovel to dig into soil, with a prominent "811" logo featuring a shovel blade, suggesting a safety or utility marking message.

photo:
Scene Overview :
  • Main subject: Lower legs of a person wearing bright red rubber boots, stepping on a metal shovel blade inserted into dark soil.
  • Setting: Outdoor garden or yard with green plants in the background.
  • Perspective: Ground-level, close-up view focused on the action of digging.
  • Composition: The boots and shovel dominate the foreground; the "811" logo is superimposed near the shovel blade.
  • Lighting: Natural daylight, even illumination.
  • Colour palette: Dominated by red (boots), brown (soil), green (background foliage), and metallic silver (shovel).

Technical Details :
  • No visible scale bar or measurement.
  • On-image text: Large "811" in yellow with a stylized shovel blade below, forming a logo.
  • No additional UI elements or digital overlays.

Spatial Relationships :
  • Foreground: Red boots, shovel, and "811" logo.
  • Background: Out-of-focus green plants.
  • The shovel is being pressed into the soil by the person's foot, indicating the act of digging.

Analysis :
  • The image visually emphasizes the act of digging and the "811" logo, which is commonly associated with the "Call Before You Dig" safety campaign in the United States, warning people to contact utility location services before digging to avoid underground hazards. <!-- figure, from page 5 (l=0.053,t=0.200,r=0.260,b=0.390), with ID 1e638a1b-e32f-42b4-ab3c-8727e336b9cc -->

DIG SAFE

Smart digging means always calling Miss Utility at 811 at least two full business days (but not more than 10 days) before you begin excavations on any project — from home landscaping and gardening to large construction jobs. <!-- text, from page 5 (l=0.274,t=0.200,r=0.892,b=0.292), with ID 32e46c6c-6b4f-4903-8bb9-f4dd75317a6f -->

With one free call, representatives will visit your proposed dig site and mark the locations of underground electrical wires, gas pipelines and other utilities. Calling 811 before you dig is the first step in preventing damage to underground utilities that can cause serious injuries, disruptions of a neighborhood’s critical services and expensive penalties and repair costs.

PLANTING TREES

BGE recommends the Arbor Day Foundation’s The Right Tree, the Right Place guideline which advises that any trees planted within 20 feet on either side of pole-to-pole power lines have a mature height of less than 25 feet. For more information on how to comply with the HVLA by choosing the right tree for the right place on your property please visit BGE.COM/TreeCare. <!-- text, from page 5 (l=0.052,t=0.423,r=0.614,b=0.555), with ID 19d096b1-533b-4660-b938-4febd40ac002 -->

Summary : This illustration shows recommended tree heights at various distances from a power pole, emphasizing safe planting distances to avoid interference with overhead power lines.

illustration:
# Tree Height vs. Distance from Power Pole :
  • The image displays three trees of varying heights, each positioned at different distances from a power pole.
  • The power pole is marked with a height of 50 feet.
  • The Y-axis on the right is labeled "TREE HEIGHT" with tick marks at 0', 10', 20', 30', 40', and 50'.
  • The X-axis at the bottom is labeled "DISTANCE FROM POWER POLE" with tick marks at 0', 40', and 70'.

# Tree Placement and Heights :
  • At 0' from the power pole: Smallest tree, approximately 15' tall.
  • At 40' from the power pole: Medium tree, approximately 25' tall.
  • At 70' from the power pole: Largest tree, approximately 45' tall.

# Design Encodings :
  • Trees are illustrated in green, with size proportional to their recommended height.
  • The power pole is shown in blue, with crossbars at the top.
  • Axis labels and tick marks are clearly marked in blue and green.

# Analysis :
  • The illustration visually communicates that taller trees should be planted farther from power poles, while only small trees are suitable for planting directly beneath or near power lines. This helps prevent trees from growing into power lines and causing safety hazards. <!-- figure, from page 5 (l=0.627,t=0.418,r=0.902,b=0.558), with ID 75221dd6-d23b-4002-89c0-ff1aaf843ebd -->

Summary : This illustration compares two different refrigerator designs, showing their external features and general shapes.

illustration:
# Refrigerator Designs :

## Left Refrigerator (Blue) :
  • Side-by-side door design with two vertical handles.
  • Features an external water/ice dispenser on the left door.
  • Rectangular, boxy shape with short feet at the bottom.
  • Minimalist design with a small horizontal rectangle near the top right, possibly representing a display or control panel.

## Right Refrigerator (Green) :
  • Bottom-freezer design with two main compartments: upper (refrigerator) and lower (freezer).
  • Curved handles integrated into the doors.
  • Rounded corners and a softer, more modern appearance.
  • Snowflake icon in the upper right corner, indicating the freezer section.
  • No visible external dispenser.

# Spatial Relationships :
  • The two refrigerators are placed side by side, with the blue model on the left and the green model on the right.
  • Both are shown from the front, centered in the frame, and occupy similar vertical space.

# Analysis :
  • The illustration highlights the visual and functional differences between a side-by-side refrigerator with an external dispenser and a bottom-freezer refrigerator with a more streamlined appearance.
  • The use of distinct colors and icons helps differentiate the two models and their features. <!-- figure, from page 5 (l=0.443,t=0.808,r=0.670,b=0.960), with ID e31dbb7e-8c47-4d40-a8cd-e66d2868d512 -->

Summary : This image shows a simple, stylized illustration of a refrigerator viewed from the front, with a vertical handle on the left side.

photo:
Scene Overview :
