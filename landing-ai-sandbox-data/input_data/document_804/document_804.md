Summary : This image shows two social media icons, Facebook and Twitter, in grayscale, side by side on a white background.

logo:  
Scene Overview : 
  â€¢ Contains two distinct logos: the Facebook "f" and the Twitter bird.
  â€¢ Both icons are rendered in a medium gray color.
  â€¢ The icons are horizontally aligned, with Facebook on the left and Twitter on the right.
  â€¢ The background is plain white, with no additional text or design elements.

Technical Details : 
  â€¢ No company names or taglines are present.
  â€¢ The Facebook icon is the stylized lowercase "f".

Summary : This bar chart presents the monthly electric usage history in kilowatt hours (kWh) alongside the average monthly temperature (Â°F) for a one-year period, from May to the following May.

bar chart:
Title & Axes :
  â€¢ Title: "Electric Usage History in Kilowatt Hours (kWh)"
  â€¢ X-axis: Months (MAY, JUN, JUL, AUG, SEP, OCT, NOV, DEC, JAN, FEB, MAR, APR, MAY) with corresponding average monthly temperatures (Â°F) labeled below each month.
  â€¢ Y-axis: Electric usage in kilowatt hours (kWh), with values shown above each bar.

Data Points :
  â€¢ MAY (58Â°): 9216 kWh
  â€¢ JUN (72Â°): 9984 kWh
  â€¢ JUL (74Â°): 9600 kWh
  â€¢ AUG (76Â°): 9216 kWh
  â€¢ SEP (75Â°): 8064 kWh
  â€¢ OCT (66Â°): 11904 kWh
  â€¢ NOV (47Â°): 15744 kWh

  â€¢ MAR (39Â°): 18048 kWh
  â€¢ APR (44Â°): 18048 kWh
  â€¢ MAY (63Â°): 15744 kWh

Design Encodings :
  â€¢ Each month is represented by a vertical bar.
  â€¢ Bars are colored in shades of blue, with no explicit legend for color variation.
  â€¢ Average monthly temperature is shown as a number with a degree symbol below each month.

Distribution & Trends :
  â€¢ Electric usage is lowest in September (8064 kWh) and highest in February (23424 kWh).
  â€¢ Usage is relatively low from May through September, increases in October, and peaks in the winter months (November through March).
  â€¢ There is a general inverse relationship between average monthly temperature and electric usage: as temperature decreases, electric usage increases.

Analysis :
  â€¢ The data shows a clear seasonal pattern: electric usage is lowest during the warmer months (late spring through early fall) and rises sharply as temperatures drop in late fall and winter, peaking in the coldest months (January and February).
  â€¢ The pattern suggests increased electric consumption for heating during colder months.
  â€¢ There is a secondary rise in usage in October and a drop after March as temperatures rise again.
  â€¢ The repeated May data point at the end (15744 kWh, 63Â°) is higher than the previous May, indicating possible year-to-year variation or a change in usage pattern. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.033,t=0.333,r=0.612,b=0.460), with ID 745dfd42-5369-4dd8-8620-489e0b7a8a70 -->

# Design Encodings :
  â€¢ Bars are light blue.
  â€¢ Each bar is labeled with its exact therm value above.
  â€¢ Average monthly temperature is shown below each month in smaller text.

# Distribution & Trends :
  â€¢ Gas usage is zero from June through October.
  â€¢ Usage begins to rise in November, peaks in February, and then declines through May.
  â€¢ The highest usage is in February (5841 therms), with a secondary peak in January (5173 therms).
  â€¢ Usage is lowest (excluding zero months) in May (350 and 188 therms) and November (1523 therms).

# Analysis :
  â€¢ Gas usage is strongly seasonal, with no usage during the warmest months (Juneâ€“October, average temperatures 66Â°â€“76Â°F).
  â€¢ Usage increases sharply as temperatures drop, peaking in the coldest months (January and February, 24Â°â€“29Â°F).
  â€¢ There is a clear inverse relationship between average monthly temperature and gas usage: as temperature decreases, gas usage increases, and vice versa.
  â€¢ The pattern suggests gas is primarily used for heating. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.032,t=0.467,r=0.612,b=0.593), with ID 0b5f7176-a1fb-4ec1-8b30-93b48f72d3d5 -->
