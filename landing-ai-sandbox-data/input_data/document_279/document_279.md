  • December (first): ~17
  • January: ~13
  • February: ~15
  • March: ~17
  • April: ~15
  • May: ~21
  • June: ~28
  • July: ~28
  • August: ~27
  • September: ~25
  • October: ~23
  • November: ~18
  • December (last): ~16

Design Encodings :
  • Bars are light grey, except the last December bar, which is green.
  • No gridlines or additional markers.
  • No error bars or statistical annotations.

Distribution & Trends :
  • Demand is lowest in January (~13).
  • Demand rises steadily from April (~15) to a peak in June and July (~28).
  • After July, demand gradually decreases through November (~18).
  • The last December bar (~16) is highlighted in green.

Analysis :
  • The demand profile is seasonal, with a clear peak in the summer months (June–August) and lower demand in winter (January, December).
  • The green bar for the last December may indicate a special emphasis or forecasted value.
  • The pattern suggests higher demand in mid-year, tapering off towards the end and beginning of the year. <!-- figure, from page 2 (l=0.035,t=0.394,r=0.426,b=0.575), with ID d244aa91-6ef3-4ba5-8584-e1fa03e2d6a4 -->

Summary : This image shows a small, square, high-contrast black-and-white pattern typical of a 2D barcode, specifically a DataMatrix code, with a dense arrangement of black and white modules.

barcode:  
Type & Structure :  
  • Barcode type: DataMatrix (square, 2D matrix of black and white modules).  
  • Approximate module count: 14 × 14.  
  • Quiet zone: 1 module width on all sides.  

Content :  
  • Encoded string: [illegible] (content not readable at this resolution).  
  • No visible numeric or alphanumeric string.  

Design & Placement :  
  • Black modules on white background.  
  • No visible text, logo, or additional markings.  
  • Square aspect ratio, no orientation marker visible at this scale.  

Analysis :  
  • The barcode is likely used for compact data encoding (e.g., serial numbers, URLs, or product info) in industrial or packaging contexts.  
  • The resolution is too low to extract the encoded data or any error correction pattern details. <!-- figure, from page 2 (l=0.034,t=0.884,r=0.074,b=0.920), with ID fe906381-26fe-41bb-b837-f6b3b98c761b -->
