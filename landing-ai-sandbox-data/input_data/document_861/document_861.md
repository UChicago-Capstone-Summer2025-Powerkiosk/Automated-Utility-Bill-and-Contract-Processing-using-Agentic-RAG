logo: SCG

• The image is a logo featuring three overlapping leaf- and droplet-shaped elements in green, blue, and orange, arranged from left to right.
• Below the graphic, the text "SCG" appears in bold, green, sans-serif capital letters.
• The green shape on the left resembles a leaf with a visible vein, the blue and orange shapes resemble water and flame droplets, respectively.
• The background is white, and there is no additional text or tagline.

Analysis :
• The use of green, blue, and orange suggests themes of sustainability, water, and energy or environmental responsibility.
• The logo’s clean, modern design and colour palette likely aim to convey eco-friendliness and innovation. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.074,t=0.023,r=0.184,b=0.120), with ID f4855eb7-8458-416e-bd11-27db1d90b9c1 -->
