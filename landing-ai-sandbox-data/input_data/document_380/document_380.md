Summary : This instructional figure shows five analog-style electric meter dials, used to guide users in reading and reporting their electric meter readings by telephone or online, with explicit instructions not to mail the reading.

diagram:
Instructions & Title : 
  • Title at top: "Provide reading by telephone or on-line only: DO NOT MAIL" (bold, underlined).
  • Instruction below dials: "Draw hands on the dials exactly as they appear on your electric meter. When reading your meter, if the hand falls between two numbers, always record the lower number."

Dial Layout : 
  • Five circular dials arranged horizontally, each labeled 0–9 in a clockwise direction.
  • Each dial has a single hand pointing to a number or between numbers.
  • Dials are unlabelled but are intended to be read left to right as sequential digits of a meter reading.

Design Encodings : 
  • Black and white line art.
  • Each dial is identical in style, with tick marks for each number.
  • No color or additional symbols.

Analysis : 
  • The figure is designed to instruct users on how to accurately transcribe the positions of meter hands for remote reporting.
  • Emphasis is placed on always recording the lower number when the hand is between two digits.
  • The uniformity of the dials and clear instructions aim to reduce user error in meter reading submission. <!-- figure, from page 1 (l=0.134,t=0.668,r=0.843,b=0.764), with ID 3508dfd5-e491-45db-a94f-c7b8ee9cbfb4 -->
