Summary : This bar chart displays the daily electric usage in kilowatt hours (kWh) for each month, along with the corresponding average temperature, over a one-year period.

bar chart:

# Title & Axes :
  • Title: "Electric Usage History – Kilowatt Hours (kWh)"
  • Y-axis: "kWh/Day", tick marks at 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35.
  • X-axis: Months from Dec to Dec (13 bars), each labeled with the month and average temperature (°F): Dec 35°, Jan 38°, Feb 35°, Mar 41°, Apr 54°, May 60°, Jun 68°, Jul 72°, Aug 67°, Sep 66°, Oct 58°, Nov 41°, Dec 40°.

# Data Points :
  • Each bar represents average daily electric usage (kWh) for the month.
  • Heights (approximate, as exact values are not labeled):
    – Dec (35°): ~21 kWh/day
    – Jan (38°): ~25 kWh/day
    – Feb (35°): ~28 kWh/day
    – Mar (41°): ~23 kWh/day
    – Apr (54°): ~26 kWh/day
    – May (60°): ~25 kWh/day
    – Jun (68°): ~22 kWh/day
    – Jul (72°): ~22 kWh/day
    – Aug (67°): ~23 kWh/day
    – Sep (66°): ~23 kWh/day
    – Oct (58°): ~30 kWh/day
    – Nov (41°): ~25 kWh/day
    – Dec (40°): ~25 kWh/day (bar is green, others are gray)

# Design Encodings :
  • Bars are vertical.
  • All bars are gray except the last (Dec 40°), which is green.
  • X-axis labels include both month and average temperature.
  • No gridlines or error bars.

# Distribution & Trends :
  • Usage is generally higher in colder months (Dec, Jan, Feb, Oct, Nov).
  • Lower usage in warmer months (Jun, Jul, Aug, Sep).
  • October shows the highest usage (~30 kWh/day).
  • The green bar for the last December may indicate current or projected data.

# Analysis :
  • Electric usage peaks in October and is elevated in winter months, suggesting increased heating or lighting needs.
  • Usage dips during late spring and summer, likely due to reduced heating requirements.
  • The green bar for the last December may highlight a recent or forecasted value, but is similar to other winter months.
  • There is a clear seasonal pattern: higher usage at lower average temperatures. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.052,t=0.176,r=0.432,b=0.438), with ID 7bebdb30-5328-4ed3-b57a-de89a7725537 -->
