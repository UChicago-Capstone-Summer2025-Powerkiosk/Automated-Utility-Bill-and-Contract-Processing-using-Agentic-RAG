When reading your meter, if the hand falls between two numbers, always report the lower number.\"\n  • \"If you have a DIGITAL METER write the numbers here:\" followed by five empty boxes.\n\nAnalysis :\n  • The figure is designed to minimize errors in self-reported electric meter readings by clarifying the correct way to interpret dial positions and by providing a space for digital readings.\n  • The alternating dial directions and the instruction to report the lower number help prevent common mistakes.\n  • The layout is clear and user-friendly, supporting accurate data collection for utility billing. <!-- figure, from page 1 (l=0.266,t=0.671,r=0.728,b=0.789), with ID c819c25b-26dd-4cf0-aeb9-80a44736bf2e -->\n\nSummary : This image shows a series of horizontal black and white bars of varying thickness, arranged in a vertical stack, resembling a barcode or resolution test pattern.\n\nbarcode:  \n\nType & Structure :  \n  • No visible numeric or alphanumeric string.  \n  • Consists of 10 groups of horizontal black and white bars.  \n  • Each group contains bars of different thicknesses, with the thickness increasing from top to bottom.  \n  • No visible quiet zone or border.  \n  • No text, numbers, or labels present.  \n  • Not a standard barcode type (e.g., EAN-13, QR, DataMatrix); resembles a resolution or alignment test pattern.\n\nDimensions & Placement :  \n  • Vertically oriented.  \n  • Each group of bars is separated by a small white gap.  \n  • The width of the bars is consistent within each group but varies between groups.\n\nAnalysis :  \n  • The pattern is likely used for testing or calibrating resolution, alignment, or print quality, rather than for encoding data.  \n  • The increasing bar thickness from top to bottom suggests a gradient for assessing visual or scanning performance. <!-- figure, from page 1 (l=0.192,t=0.817,r=0.249,b=0.901), with ID 1a15e946-6086-426c-a191-8fc716820e56 -->","chunks":[{"text":"logo: Met-Ed, A FirstEnergy Company\n\nScene Overview : \n  • The image is a logo featuring the text \"Met-Ed\" in bold, italicized font with a swoosh underline.\n  • Below the main text, in smaller font, is the tagline \"A FirstEnergy Company\".\n  • The design is monochrome (black/grey on white background).\n\nTechnical Details : \n  • No additional graphic elements, icons, or color accents are present.\n  • The text is left-aligned, with the swoosh extending from left to right under \"Met-Ed\".\n\nSpatial Relationships : \n  • \"Met-Ed\" is the dominant element, occupying the upper portion.\n  • The tagline is directly beneath, smaller and less prominent.\n\nAnalysis : \n  • The logo clearly identifies the company as Met-Ed, a subsidiary or division of FirstEnergy, using a clean and professional design with a dynamic underline to suggest energy or movement.","grounding":[{"page":0,"box":{"l":0.19274555146694183,"t":0.014120426960289478,"r":0.26669013500213623,"b":0.044518593698740005},"image_path":null}],"chunk_type":"figure","chunk_id":"fe199caa-da5d-4fff-9651-cdc9c5d52acf"},{"text":"Bill Based On: Actual Meter Reading","grounding":[{"page":0,"box":{"l":0.35507261753082275,"t":0.01904480904340744,"r":0.5042810440063477,"b":0.034754082560539246},"image_path":null}],"chunk_type":"marginalia","chunk_id":"59b8f2a7-5362-483b-b0b1-83e0db04a7fb"},{"text":"Page 1 of 2  \nM71","grounding":[{"page":0,"box":{"l":0.736025333404541,"t":0.01727866753935814,"r":0.7884277105331421,"b":0.03778740018606186},"image_path":null}],"chunk_type":"marginalia","chunk_id":"262607e1-6fe4-488a-9f7c-3bda3ed715c7"},{"text":"Aug 11, 2024 for 31 days  \nTERTAINMENT GRP  \n1 CENTER DR  \n17408","grounding":[{"page":0,"box":{"l":0.29615122079849243,"t":0.037679217755794525,"r":0.5068607926368713,"b":0.08312561362981796},"image_path":null}],"chunk_type":"text","chunk_id":"62b7e72b-e7d5-4fe5-8fde-2b300d0da3be"},{"text":"Account Number: 100 155 441 973\n\nAmount Due: $1,851.72\n\nDue Date: August 29, 2024","grounding":[{"page":0,"box":{"l":0.5570668578147888,"t":0.03550463169813156,"r":0.8013448119163513,"b":0.08612948656082153},"image_path":null}],"chunk_type":"text","chunk_id":"7f723ee5-8a86-4dda-87be-0ef52ddc0407"},{"text":"Billing Period: Jul 12 to Aug 11, 2024 for 31 days\nBill For:      REGAL ENTERTAINMENT GRP\n               455 TOWN CENTER DR\n               YORK PA 17408","grounding":[{"page":0,"box":{"l":0.19067220389842987,"t":0.04814216494560242,"r":0.3968333601951599,"b":0.08608837425708771},"image_path":null}],"chunk_type":"text","chunk_id":"d0e6ddb4-a2f3-4839-a6ef-397296fddef9"},{"text":"To report an emergency or an outage, call 24 hours a day 1-888-544-4877.\nBill issued by: Met-Ed, PO Box 16001, Reading, PA 19612-6001\nTo enroll in eBill or pay your bill online, scan the QR code on the right of this bill from your mobile device or go to www.firstenergycorp.com\nFor Customer Service, call 1-800-545-7741.
