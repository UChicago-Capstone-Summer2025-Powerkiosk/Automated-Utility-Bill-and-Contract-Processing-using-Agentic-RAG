months of the year (D to N).\n\nbar chart:\nTitle & Axes :\n  • Title: \"Energy Profile\".\n  • Y-axis: \"KWH\" (kilowatt-hours), with tick marks at 0, 10000, 20000, 30000, 40000.\n  • X-axis: Months labeled as D, J, F, M, A, M, J, J, A, S, O, N, D (presumably December to November, with D repeated at both ends).\n\nData Points :\n  • Series \"onpk\" (lighter bars): Monthly KWH values, generally lower than \"offpk\" for each month.\n  • Series \"offpk\" (darker bars): Monthly KWH values, generally higher than \"onpk\", with a pronounced spike in September.\n  • Both series are present for each month.\n\nDesign Encodings :\n  • \"onpk\" and \"offpk\" are distinguished by different bar fill patterns (as indicated in the legend).\n  • Grouped bar format for each month.\n  • No error bars or additional statistical annotations.\n\nDistribution & Trends :\n  • Most months show \"offpk\" consumption exceeding \"onpk\".\n  • September (\"S\") displays a dramatic spike in \"offpk\" KWH, reaching the highest value on the chart (over 35000 KWH).\n  • Other months show moderate variation, with both series generally between 5000 and 20000 KWH.\n  • October (\"O\") also shows a secondary peak in \"offpk\".\n\nAnalysis :\n  • \"offpk\" energy usage is consistently higher than \"onpk\" throughout the year.\n  • There is a significant anomaly in September, where \"offpk\" consumption surges far above all other months.\n  • October also shows elevated \"offpk\" usage, but not as extreme as September.\n  • The rest of the year displays relatively stable energy consumption for both categories, with minor fluctuations. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.044,t=0.307,r=0.283,b=0.449), with ID ab063f2c-d6b7-4fcf-8bba-3851ad94e810 -->\n\nSummary : This bar chart shows the monthly maximum

ranging from 0 to 250 in increments of 50.\n  • X-axis: Months, labeled by initials: D, J, F, M, A, M, J, J, A, S, O, N, D.\n\nData Points :\n  • Each bar represents the maximum KW demand for a given month.\n  • The highest bar occurs in September (S), reaching just below 200 KW.\n  • Other months generally range between approximately 75 KW and 125 KW.\n\nDesign Encodings :\n  • Bars are uniform in color and style.\n  • No additional series, error bars, or trend lines.\n\nDistribution & Trends :\n  • Most months show similar demand levels, except for a pronounced spike in September.\n  • No clear upward or downward trend across the year, aside from the outlier.\n\nAnalysis :\n  • The data reveals a significant outlier in September, where demand nearly doubles compared to other months.\n  • The rest of the year exhibits relatively stable demand, with minor fluctuations.\n  • The September spike may indicate a seasonal or event-driven increase in demand. <!-- figure, from page 0

except for the two central bars (A, J) which are slightly higher, close to 8 cents per KWH.\n\nDesign Encodings :\n  • Bars are vertical and shaded with a light fill.\n  • No colour differentiation between bars.\n  • No error bars or additional markers.\n\nDistribution & Trends :\n  • Most months cluster around 6–7 cents per KWH.\n  • Two months (A, J) show a small peak, reaching just under 8 cents per KWH.\n\nAnalysis :\n  • The generation rate is relatively stable across most months, with a minor increase in the middle months (A, J). No extreme outliers or sharp trends are visible. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.535,t=0.300,r=0.779,b=0.443), with ID f23ff355-34b8-475b-a7ab-7da3ed65ce5c -->\n\nMeter Information\n<table><thead><tr><th>METER #</th><th>RATE</th><th>BILLING PERIOD FROM</th><th>TO</th><th>DAYS</th><th>METER READINGS PREVIOUS</th><th>CURRENT</th><th>CONSTANT</th><th>DEMAND</th><th>KILOWATT HOURS USED</th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>081035801</td><td>027</td><td>Nov 8</td><td>Dec 11</td><td>33</td><td>0</td><td>11389</td><td>1.00</td><td>95.6</td><td>11389</td><td>ONPK PURCH</td></tr><tr><td>081035801</td><td>027</td><td>Nov 8</td><td>Dec 11</td><td>33</td><td>0</td><td>26673</td><td>1.00</td><td>103.3</td><td>26673</td><td>OFFPK PURCH</td></tr><tr><td>081035801</td><td>027</td><td>Nov 8</td><td>Dec 11</td><td>33</td><td>0</td><td>238</td><td>1.00</td><td>0.0</td><td>238</td><td>ONPK SALES</td></tr><tr><td>081035801</td><td>027</td><td>Nov 8</td><td>Dec 11</td><td>33</td><td>0</td><td>1409</td><td>1.00</td><td>0.0</td><td>1409</td><td>OFFPK SALES</td></tr></tbody></table>\nYour Supplier: NEXTERA ENERGY SERVICES CONNECTICUT\nPhone: (866) 410-4392\n20 GREENWAY PLAZA\nSUITE 600\nHOUSTON, TX 77046\n\nMail Payment To: EVERSOURCE\nPO BOX 56002\nBOSTON MA 02205-6002 <!-- table, from page 0 (l=0.036,t=0.454,r=0.801,b=0.580), with ID 15cbe3f9-e122-48bc-9c46-6f7418010ec2 -->\n\nSummary : This is a simple blue line drawing of a loaf of bread, depicted with curved lines and internal scoring marks.\n\nillustration:\nScene Overview :\n  • Main subject is a stylized loaf of bread, drawn in blue ink.\n  • The loaf is shown as an oval with three curved lines inside, representing scoring or cuts on the bread's surface.\n  • The drawing is minimalistic, with no background or additional elements.\n\nTechnical Details :\n  • No scale bar, text, or annotations are present.\n  • The illustration uses a single blue color for all lines.\n\nSpatial Relationships :\n  • The loaf is oriented diagonally from lower left to upper right.\n  • The scoring lines are parallel and evenly spaced within the loaf outline.\n\nAnalysis :\n  • The image conveys the recognizable shape and scoring pattern of a traditional loaf of bread, using simple lines for clarity and emphasis. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.836,t=0.535,r=0.904,b=0.597), with ID 5778fa5d-edcf-443f-b92c-4cdfd5ef9338 -->\n\nSummary : This is a handwritten identifier or code, likely referencing a document, form, or postal address.\n\nlogo / stamp / identifier:\n  Text Content :\n    • The text reads: \"P.O. 240 262\".\n    • \"P.O.\" is commonly an abbreviation for \"Post Office\" or \"Purchase Order\".\n    • The numbers \"240 262\" follow the abbreviation, separated by a space.\n  Style & Placement :\n    • Handwritten in black ink.\n    • Rounded, cursive style for \"P.O.\", more upright for the numbers.\n    • No additional graphic elements, borders, or logos.\n    • No visible date, signature, or decorative features.\n    • No indication of physical dimensions or placement context.\n\nAnalysis :\n  • The mark serves as a simple handwritten reference code, likely for organizational or tracking purposes.

except for a pronounced spike in September.\n  • No clear upward or downward trend across the year, aside from the outlier.\n\nAnalysis :\n  • The data reveals a significant outlier in September, where demand nearly doubles compared to other months.\n  • The rest of the year exhibits relatively stable demand, with minor fluctuations.\n  • The September spike may indicate a seasonal or event-driven increase in demand.","grounding":[{"page":0,"box":{"l":0.2916286289691925,"t":0.2993542551994324,"r":0.5261812806129456,"b":0.444629967212677},"image_path":null}],"chunk_type":"figure","chunk_id":"89759a65-7c30-4181-bd92-cbeae3c1b37c"},{"text":"Summary
