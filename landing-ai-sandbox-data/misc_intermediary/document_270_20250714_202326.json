-->\n\nSummary : This bar chart presents the monthly energy consumption profile in kilowatt-hours (KWH) for two categories, \"onpk\" and \"offpk\", across the months of the year.\n\nbar chart:\nTitle & Axes :\n  • Title: \"Energy Profile\".\n  • Y-axis: \"KWH\" (kilowatt-hours), with tick marks at 0, 10000, 20000, 30000, and 40000.\n  • X-axis: Months labeled as D, J, F, M, A, M, J, J, A, S, O, N, D (presumably December through November, with December repeated at both ends).\n\nData Points :\n  • Series \"onpk\" (lighter bars): Monthly KWH values for each month, generally lower than \"offpk\".\n  • Series \"offpk\" (darker bars): Monthly KWH values for each month, generally higher than \"onpk\", with a pronounced spike in September.\n  • Exact values are not labeled, but relative heights indicate trends.\n\nDesign Encodings :\n  • Two bar patterns: \"onpk\" (lighter fill), \"offpk\" (darker fill).\n  • Grouped bars for each month.\n  • No error bars or additional statistical annotations.\n\nDistribution & Trends :\n  • Both \"onpk\" and \"offpk\" show monthly variation.\n  • \"offpk\" is consistently higher than \"onpk\" for all months.\n  • September shows a dramatic spike in \"offpk\" consumption, reaching the highest value on the chart.\n  • Other months show moderate variation, with some months (e.g., January, October, December) having higher values than others (e.g., May, June, July).\n\nAnalysis :\n  • The energy consumption for \"offpk\" is consistently greater than \"onpk\" throughout the year.\n  • There is a significant anomaly in September, where \"offpk\" usage surges to a peak far above all other months.\n  • The rest of the year shows moderate fluctuations, with some seasonality possibly present, but no other months approach the September peak.\n  • The pattern suggests a possible event or operational change in September affecting \"offpk\" energy use. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.044,t=0.307,r=0.283,b=0.449), with ID

letter.\n\nbar chart:\n\nTitle & Axes :\n  • Title: \"Demand History\".\n  • Y-axis label: \"Max KW\" (kilowatts), with tick marks at 0, 50, 100, 150, 200, 250.\n  • X-axis: Months, labeled by initials: D, J, F, M, A, M, J, J, A, S, O, N, D (presumably December through December).\n\nData Points :\n  • Each bar represents the maximum KW demand for a given month.\n  • Most months have values between approximately 75 and 125 KW.\n  • One month (September, labeled \"S\") shows a significant spike, reaching just below 200 KW.\n  • All other months remain below 150 KW.\n\nDesign Encodings :\n  • Bars are uniform in color and style.\n  • No additional series, error bars, or trend lines.\n\nDistribution & Trends :\n  • The data is relatively stable across most months, with a single prominent outlier.\n  • The highest demand occurs in September.\n  • No clear upward or downward trend across the year.\n\nAnalysis :\n  • The demand is generally consistent except for a sharp peak in September, indicating an unusual event or seasonal effect during that month.\n  • No other months approach the September maximum, suggesting the spike is an anomaly rather than part of a regular pattern. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.292,t=0.299,r=0.526,b=0.445), with ID e7c3e07d-d91f-4639-89b7-e03fc933a41d -->\n\nSummary : This bar chart shows the generation rate in cents per kilowatt-hour (KWH) for different months, with each bar representing a specific month labeled by its initial.\n\nbar chart:\nTitle & Axes :\n  • Title: \"Generation Rate\"\n  • Y-axis: \"Cents Per KWH\" with tick marks at 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20.\n  • X-axis: Month initials labeled as D, F, A, J, A, O, D.\n\nData Points :\n  • Each bar corresponds to a month (D, F, A, J, A, O, D).\n  • All bars are between 6 and 8 cents per KWH, except for the two central bars (A and J), which are slightly higher, close to 8 cents per KWH.\n\nDesign Encodings :\n  • Bars are vertical and shaded with a light fill.\n  • No additional colours, markers, or error bars are present.\n\nDistribution & Trends :\n  • Most months cluster just above 6 cents per KWH.\n  • Two months (A and J) show a noticeable but small increase, approaching 8 cents per KWH.\n\nAnalysis :\n  • The generation rate is relatively stable across most months, with a slight peak in the middle months (A and J). There are no extreme outliers or dramatic changes in the data. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.535,t=0.300,r=0.779,b=0.443), with ID a6a89b8c-f969-4646-934d-fbb17eb47092 -->\n\nMeter Information\n<table><thead><tr><th>METER #</th><th>RATE</th><th>BILLING PERIOD FROM</th><th>TO</th><th>DAYS</th><th>PREVIOUS</th><th>CURRENT</th><th>CONSTANT</th><th>DEMAND</th><th>KILOWATT HOURS USED</th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>081035801</td><td>027</td><td>Nov 8</td><td>Dec 11</td><td>33</td><td>0</td><td>11389</td><td>1.00</td><td>95.6</td><td>11389</td><td>ONPK PURCH</td></tr><tr><td>081035801</td><td>027</td><td>Nov 8</td><td>Dec 11</td><td>33</td><td>0</td><td>26673</td><td>1.00</td><td>103.3</td><td>26673</td><td>OFFPK PURCH</td></tr><tr><td>081035801</td><td>027</td><td>Nov 8</td><td>Dec 11</td><td>33</td><td>0</td><td>238</td><td>1.00</td><td>0.0</td><td>238</td><td>ONPK SALES</td></tr><tr><td>081035801</td><td>027</td><td>Nov 8</td><td>Dec 11</td><td>33</td><td>0</td><td>1409</td><td>1.00</td><td>0.0</td><td>1409</td><td>OFFPK SALES</td></tr></tbody></table>\nYour Supplier: NEXTERA ENERGY SERVICES CONNECTICUT\nPhone: (866) 410-4392\n20 GREENWAY PLAZA\nSUITE 600\nHOUSTON, TX 77046\nMail Payment To: EVERSOURCE\nPO BOX 56002\nBOSTON MA 02205-6002 <!-- table, from page 0 (l=0.036,t=0.454,r=0.801,b=0.580), with ID c7aa4254-0768-4a52-a42a-32709b88b841 -->\n\nSummary : This is a simple blue line drawing of a loaf of bread, depicted with curved lines and internal scoring marks.\n\nillustration:\nScene Overview :\n  • Main subject is a stylized loaf of bread, shown in outline.\n  • The loaf is drawn with a single continuous blue line forming an oval shape.\n  • Three curved lines inside the loaf represent scoring or cuts typical of bread.\n  • The drawing is minimalistic, with no background or additional elements.\n\nTechnical Details :\n  • No scale bar, text, or annotations present.\n  • The illustration uses a single blue color for all lines.\n  • No shading, texture, or perspective cues.\n\nSpatial Relationships :\n  • The loaf is oriented diagonally from lower left to upper right.\n  • The scoring lines are parallel and evenly spaced within the loaf outline.\n\nAnalysis :\n  • The image conveys the recognizable shape and scoring of a loaf of bread in a simple, iconic style. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.836,t=0.535,r=0.904,b=0.597), with ID a8b6dbc3-eb80-4e09-bf3f-515bc5ac7617 -->\n\nSummary : This is a handwritten identifier or code, likely referencing a document, record, or postal box.\n\nlogo / stamp / identifier:\n  Text Content :\n    • \"P.O. 240 262\" written in cursive/print hybrid handwriting.\n    • \"P.O.\" is commonly an abbreviation for \"Post Office\" or \"P.O.

September.\n  • No clear upward or downward trend across the year.\n\nAnalysis :\n  • The demand is generally consistent except for a sharp peak in September, indicating an unusual event or seasonal
