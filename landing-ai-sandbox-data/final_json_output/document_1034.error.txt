You are an expert data extraction agent. Your task is to convert a utility document (bill or contract) from Markdown format into a single, valid JSON object.

You MUST strictly adhere to the JSON schema provided below. Do not add fields that are not in the schema. If a value for a non-required field is not found, omit it or use `null`. For required fields, make your best effort to find the value; if it's truly absent, use a placeholder like "NOT_FOUND".

<schema>
{
// ... PASTE THE ENTIRE CONTENT of main_usage_schema.json HERE ...
}
</schema>

Here are specific instructions based on the document type:

1.  **Determine `documentType`**: First, identify if the document is a "sampleBill" or a "contract". Contracts usually have terms like "Agreement", "Confirmation", or "Seller/Buyer". Bills have "Billing Summary", "Amount Due", etc.
2.  **`documentId`**: Use the document's original filename (e.g., "document_55").
3.  **For Contracts (`documentType: "contract"`)**:
    *   `contractStart` and `contractEnd`: Extract these from the delivery period or term.
    *   `usageHistory`: This should be the **forecasted usage**. Look for tables titled "Forecasted Volume" or similar, often found in a CSV file. The keys must be in "YYYY-MM" format. If only one year of data is given for a multi-year contract, you MUST repeat the monthly values for all years of the contract. If only an annual total is given, divide by 12 and apply to each month.
    *   `locations`: Extract all service addresses, account numbers, and meter numbers from the facility attachments or tables. The CSV data is the most likely source for this. Aggregate all of them into the `locations` array.
4.  **For Bills (`documentType: "sampleBill"`)**:
    *   `statementDate`: Find the bill date or statement date.
    *   `usageHistory`: Look for a "Billing History" or "Usage Profile" chart/table showing past usage. Extract the monthly usage from this.
    *   `locations`: A bill may have one or many service addresses. Extract all you can find.
    *   `totalUsage`: Find the "Total kWh Used" or "Current Usage" for the billing period.

Now, process the following document. The Markdown content is provided first, followed by the content of any referenced CSV files.

Summary : This image shows a logo for "Ameren Illinois" with a green and red circular graphic element.

logo: Ameren Illinois  
Text & Tagline :  
  • "Ameren" in bold black font.  
  • "ILLINOIS" in smaller uppercase letters above "Ameren".  
Graphic Elements :

Summary : This image shows a blue rectangular button with the text "LOG OUT" displayed upside down, likely as part of a user interface screenshot.

screenshot:
Scene Overview :
  • Main subject is a rectangular button centered on a blue background.
  • The button contains the text "LOG OUT" in all capital letters, but the text is upside down.
  • The background is a solid blue color, and the button is a slightly darker blue rectangle.

Technical Details :
  • No visible scale bar, icons, or other UI elements besides the button.
  • The text orientation is inverted (rotated 180 degrees).
  • No additional text, labels, or interactive elements are present.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The button is horizontally and vertically centered within the blue background.
  • The upside-down text is centered within the button.

Analysis :
  • The upside-down "LOG OUT" text may indicate a design error, a visual cue for attention, or a demonstration of UI state. The image focuses solely on this single button and its unusual text orientation. <!-- figure, from page 7 (l=0.733,t=0.747,r=0.955,b=0.863), with ID d0af20a9-38fa-46c6-af8a-54fef0a9c24c -->

Summary : This image is a logo for Ameren Illinois, featuring the company name and a green circular graphic element.

logo: Ameren Illinois

Text & Graphic Elements :
  • The logo contains the text "Ameren" in bold black letters and "ILLINOIS" in smaller uppercase letters above it.
  • To the right of the text is a circular graphic composed of green radial segments with a single red segment, resembling a stylized sunburst or turbine.

Orientation & Placement :

  • The text and graphic are horizontally aligned, with the graphic to the right of the text.

Colour & Design :

  • The circular graphic uses green and red.
  • The background is white.

Analysis :
  • The logo uses green to suggest environmental or energy-related themes, consistent with Ameren Illinois as a utility company. The red segment may indicate focus or direction. The upside-down orientation is likely unintentional and does not affect the logo’s core elements. <!-- figure, from page 8 (l=0.796,t=0.882,r=0.935,b=0.943), with ID fd61c238-dde3-46b1-8b9c-ff1f1c7c1c19 -->

Summary : This image shows a handwritten alphanumeric string, likely serving as a code or identifier.

barcode:  
Full String :

Analysis :
  • The use of green and the sunburst/turbine motif suggests an association with energy or utilities, and the logo's color palette may imply a focus on sustainability or environmental responsibility.
  • The upside-down orientation is likely due to the image capture and not part of the intended logo design. <!-- figure, from page 5 (l=0.796,t=0.883,r=0.932,b=0.944), with ID 0a9e5c51-e07c-4bae-901c-b64d321e0e35 -->

Summary : This image shows a handwritten sequence of numbers and symbols, written in a single horizontal line.

logo:  
Text & Symbols :

Summary : This image shows a user interface button labeled "View Another Account" with a left-pointing arrow icon, presented upside down.

screenshot:
Scene Overview :
  • The main subject is a rectangular button with rounded edges, green border, and a left-pointing arrow icon on the left.
  • The button contains the text "View Another Account" in a sans-serif font.
  • The entire button is displayed upside down.

Technical Details :
  • The button has a green and white color palette.
