(Dec–Mar).\n  • Usage drops sharply in April and remains low from May through November.\n  • A slight increase is seen in the final December bar (green).\n\nAnalysis :\n  • Electricity usage is highest during colder months (Dec–Mar) when average temperatures are lowest (35°–41°), suggesting heating demand.\n  • Usage is lowest during warmer months (May–Oct, 54°–77°), indicating reduced need for heating or cooling.\n  • The green bar for December may indicate a new billing cycle or a change in reporting, but still shows increased usage compared to preceding months.\n  • The pattern demonstrates a strong seasonal effect on electricity consumption, with winter peaks and summer lows. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.038,t=0.225,r=0.420,b=0.457), with ID

: This bar chart shows the monthly demand profile, specifically the maximum demand, over a one-year period.

Demand\" (units not specified), tick labels: 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0, 1.2\n  • X-axis: Months from Dec to Dec (13 tick labels: Dec, Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr, May, Jun, Jul, Aug, Sep, Oct, Nov, Dec)\n\nData Points :\n  • February: bar height approximately 1.0\n  • March: bar height approximately 1.0\n  • All other months (Dec, Jan, Apr–Dec): bar height at or near 0\n\nDesign Encodings :\n  • Bars are shaded in grey.\n  • No additional series, error bars, or annotations.\n\nDistribution & Trends :\n  • Demand is concentrated entirely in February and March.\n  • The rest of the year shows no visible demand.\n\nAnalysis :\n  • The demand profile is highly seasonal, with all significant demand occurring in just two consecutive months (February and March), and negligible or zero demand in all other months.","grounding":[{"page":2,"box":{"l":0.0389627069234848,"t":0.19074192643165588,"r":0.4290790557861328,"b":0.3645246922969818},"image_path":null}],"chunk_type":"figure","chunk_id":"51ea5062-0ba4-4811-ba39-b5a3b6b39ed1"},{"text":"Summary : This image shows a small, square, high-contrast 2D barcode above the number \"245\".\n\nbarcode:  \nBarcode Details :  \n  • Barcode type: 2D matrix (exact type not specified; resembles DataMatrix or QR).  \n  • Approximate module count: 14 × 14.  \n  • Quiet zone: present on all sides (white border).  \n  • No visible alphanumeric string encoded within the barcode itself.  \n  • Numeric string \"245\" is printed below the barcode, likely as an identifier or reference.\n\nPlacement & Dimensions :  \n  • Barcode is centered above the number \"245\".  \n  • Barcode is square, with a white background and black modules.\n\nAnalysis :  \n  • The barcode is intended for machine reading; the number \"245\" may serve as a human-readable index or code corresponding to the barcode's encoded data.","grounding":[{"page":2,"box":{"l":0.03504558652639389,"t":0.8844559192657471,"r":0.07829290628433228,"b":0.9345510005950928},"image_path":null}],"chunk_type":"figure","chunk_id":"5bdbb756-3cd1-4089-a22f-ddd541bec42d"},{"text":"CE_231214PROD.TXT","grounding":[{"page":2,"box":{"l":0.8700439929962158,"t":0.9665306806564331,"r":0.9555644989013672,"b":0.9786107540130615},"image_path":null}],"chunk_type":"marginalia","chunk_id":"2fd7b5f3-0569-4aeb-9bca-d95db53a7124"}],"extraction":null,"extraction_metadata":null,"start_page_idx":0,"end_page_idx":2,"doc_type":"pdf","result_path":null,"errors":[],"extraction_error":null}
