1.      Transactions.  This Master Agreement sets forth the general terms and conditions governing transactions for the purchase, sale and transportation of natural gas and related products and services (each a “Transaction”) to one or more of Customer’s service locations (each, a “Point of Service Location”) as agreed to from time to time and specified in Exhibit B to a Transaction Confirmation. Each Transaction shall be evidenced by a written transaction confirmation (each a “Confirmation”) in the form set forth in Exhibit A. If Customer fails to object in writing to any term in the Confirmation within five (5) Business Days of receipt of the Confirmation, the Confirmation shall constitute the definitive written expression of the Transaction. Each Confirmation shall constitute part of and shall be subject to this Master Agreement. Nothing in this Agreement obligates either Party to enter into a Transaction at any time. This Agreement, all Exhibits thereto, and each Confirmation shall constitute a single integrated agreement between the Parties (collectively referred to as the “Agreement”). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.116,t=0.156,r=0.481,b=0.414), with ID b2537ddf-b692-405d-afc3-b031685b0f85 -->

2.      Services. Commencing on the Delivery Start Date set forth in a Confirmation and continuing throughout the Term, Customer appoints Supplier as its exclusive agent for the supply and/or transportation of natural gas to Customer's Point of Service Locations. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Supplier shall acquire and transport to Customer, and Customer shall purchase and receive, the Contract Quantity of natural gas of the relevant local gas distribution company (“LDC”) specified in a Confirmation in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. If the LDC requires Customer to install additional metering and/or related equipment at any Point of Service Location, Customer shall be solely responsible for the costs and installation thereof. Title to all natural gas hereunder shall pass from Supplier to Customer at the Delivery Point and Customer shall have the sole responsibility for transporting gas from the Delivery Point. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.115,t=0.425,r=0.480,b=0.654), with ID b61be0f5-b41c-402e-96f4-29c8e5a3d7a5 -->

2.1 Customer Qualification. Customer acknowledges and agrees that Supplier's duty to provide natural gas under any Confirmation that would require the use of an LDC's facilities is contingent upon the applicable Customer Point of Service Location qualifying for the LDC's appropriate rate or tariff schedule that would permit the use of the LDC's facilities for delivering the natural gas to that Customer Point of Service Location. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.145,t=0.661,r=0.474,b=0.768), with ID 802318f4-f07a-4b0a-8b09-bc73c528cb7e -->

2.2 Nominations. The Parties shall coordinate nomination activities such that the deadlines of the transporter of gas by a gas gathering or pipeline company or LDC (each a “Transporter”) may be met. If Customer or the LDC fails to provide Supplier with a usage nomination for any month in a timely manner, Supplier (i) may establish a nomination for such month in a commercially reasonable manner based on Customer’s historical <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.146,t=0.770,r=0.474,b=0.892), with ID 3f76f37c-f504-4afe-bd7d-9e3c2c0b5ebb -->

usage data available to Supplier, and (ii) shall have the right to use and rely on such nomination unless notified otherwise by Customer or the LDC. If Supplier or Customer becomes aware that actual deliveries are greater or lesser than the quantity of gas confirmed by a Transporter, such Party shall promptly notify the other Party. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.559,t=0.155,r=0.886,b=0.250), with ID e9d1c0e4-6752-4b32-adac-65b06fbbefa4 -->

2.3 Imbalances. The Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to avoid imposition of any fees, penalties, cash-outs, costs or charges (in cash or in kind) assessed by a Transporter for failure to satisfy balancing and/or nomination requirements (“Imbalance Charges”). If Supplier or Customer receives an invoice from a Transporter that includes Imbalance Charges, the Parties shall determine the validity and cause of such Imbalance Charges. The Party causing the imposition of the Imbalance Charges will be responsible to pay such Imbalance Charges. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.558,t=0.253,r=0.886,b=0.403), with ID 34b9b48d-75f2-4743-b5f7-e841cd2561bb -->

2.4 Transporter Restrictions. If either Party receives an operational flow order or any other usage or operating instructions, restrictions or similar notice (each an “OFO”) from a Transporter requiring action to be taken in connection with the t r a n s p o r t a t i o n o r consumption of gas pursuant to a Transaction, such Party will use commercially reasonable efforts to notify the other Party of such event in a timely manner. Such notice may be given by electronic means. Each Party will take all commercially reasonable actions required by the OFO within the time prescribed. If OFO penalties, charges, fees, costs or expenses result from the actions or inactions of one Party, then such Party shall be solely responsible for any such penalties, charges, fees, costs or expenses. Both parties agree that OFOs may require one or both parties to buy or sell quantities of natural gas in the then-current market conditions, which may be appreciably higher or lower than the Contract Price specified in a Transaction. If S u p p l i e r is responsible for nominations and balancing on a Transporter imposing an OFO or similar restriction, S u p p l i e r may (but is not required to) increase or decrease nominations, as appropriate, to avoid penalties. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.556,t=0.405,r=0.886,b=0.720), with ID c2a08967-65c5-478d-9f62-fc9a39e2a3d5 -->

Any such Holdover Term may be terminated by either party upon no less than thirty days written notice, unless otherwise expressly provided herein. The price payable during any Holdover Term shall be based on a variable rate, and may change monthly due to current and predicted weather patterns, retail competition, wholesale natural gas costs, fluctuations in natural gas supply and demand, industry regulations, pricing strategies, costs to serve customers, and many other factors.
