comparison of seasonal changes in supply rates.\n\nbar chart:\nTitle & Axes :\n  • No explicit chart title; context suggests \"Supply Rate\".\n  • Y-axis: \"Dollars / kWh\", ranging from 0 to 0.1, with tick marks at 0.02, 0.04, 0.06, 0.08, and 0.1.\n  • X-axis: Months labeled Dec, Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr, May, Jun, Jul, Aug, Sep, Oct, Nov, Dec (13 months, starting and ending with December).\n\nData Points :\n  • Each bar represents the supply rate for a given month.\n  • Dec, Jan, Feb, Mar: bars at approximately 0.065 dollars/kWh.\n  • Apr, May, Jun: bars at approximately 0.08 dollars/kWh.\n  • Jul: bar slightly below 0.08 dollars/kWh.\n  • Aug: bar at approximately 0.085 dollars/kWh (highest).\n  • Sep, Oct, Nov, Dec: bars return to approximately 0.08 dollars/kWh.\n  • The final December bar is highlighted in green.\n\nDesign Encodings :\n  • Bars are grey except for the final December, which is green.\n  • No gridlines except for faint horizontal lines at Y-axis ticks.\n  • No error bars or additional series.\n\nDistribution & Trends :\n  • Rates are steady at about 0.065 dollars/kWh from December through March.\n  • Rates increase to about 0.08 dollars/kWh from April through June.\n  • Slight dip in July, then a peak in August (~0.085 dollars/kWh).\n  • Rates stabilize at about 0.08 dollars/kWh from September through December.\n  • The final December bar is visually

supply rate for a given month.\n  • Dec, Jan, Feb, Mar: bars at approximately 0.065 dollars/kWh.\n  • Apr, May, Jun: bars at approximately 0.08 dollars/kWh.\n  • Jul: bar slightly below 0.08 dollars/kWh.\n  • Aug: bar at approximately 0.085 dollars/kWh (highest).\n  • Sep, Oct, Nov, Dec: bars return to approximately 0.08 dollars/kWh.\n  • The final December bar is highlighted in green.\n\nDesign Encodings :\n  • Bars are grey except for the final December, which is green.\n  • No gridlines except for faint horizontal lines at Y-axis ticks.\n  • No error bars or additional series.\n\nDistribution & Trends :\n  • Rates are steady at about 0.065 dollars/kWh from December through March.\n  • Rates increase to about 0.08 dollars/kWh from April through June.\n  • Slight dip in July, then a peak in August (~0.085 dollars/kWh).\n  • Rates stabilize at about 0.08 dollars/kWh from September through December.\n  • The final December bar is visually distinct (green).\n\nAnalysis :\n  • The supply rate is lowest from December to March, rises in spring, peaks in late summer (August), and then stabilizes at a higher level through the end of the year.\n  • The green bar for the final December may indicate a forecast, new rate, or special note, but this is not specified in the image.\n  • There is a clear seasonal pattern, with higher rates in warmer months.","grounding":[{"page":2,"box":{"l":0.04643118381500244,"t":0.15826335549354553,"r":0.43427619338035583,"b":0.3674744665622711},"image_path":null}],"chunk_type":"figure","chunk_id":"84283abf-ccc1-4c0a-a64f-c026b7301f5f"},{"text":"Summary
