chart shows daily usage in CCF per day across different months, allowing for comparison of usage patterns throughout the year.\n\nbar chart:\n\n# Title & Axes :\n  • Title: \"Daily Usage Chart\".\n  • Y-axis: \"CCF Per Day\", with tick labels at 6, 11, 16, 21, 26, 31, 36, 41, 46, 51, 56.\n  • X-axis: \"MONTHS\", with tick labels: O, N, D, J, F, M, A, M, J, J, A, S, O (representing October through October).\n\n# Data Points :\n  • Each bar represents daily usage for a given month.\n  • Usage values (approximate from bar heights):\n    – O (first): ~13\n    – N: ~32\n    – D: ~41\n    – J: ~46\n    – F: ~46\n    – M: ~41\n    – A: ~31\n    – M: ~21\n    – J: ~8\n    – J: ~7\n    – A: ~7\n    – S: ~7\n    – O (last): ~12\n\n# Design Encodings :\n  • Bars are filled with a dotted pattern.\n  • The last bar (October) is solid black, distinguishing it from the others.\n\n# Distribution & Trends :\n  • Usage is lowest in the summer months (June, July, August, September).\n  • Peaks in winter months (December, January, February).\n  • Gradual increase from October to January, then a decrease from March onward.\n  • The last October bar is highlighted.\n\n# Analysis :\n  • Daily usage is highest in winter (December–February) and lowest in summer (June–September).\n  • The highlighted October bar may indicate a new data point or a change in reporting.\n  • The pattern suggests seasonal variation, likely due to heating or cooling needs. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.733,t=0.630,r=0.965,b=0.799), with ID 5ea58dc1-af02-48be-a875-383a26b443bf -->\n\nEnergy Usage
