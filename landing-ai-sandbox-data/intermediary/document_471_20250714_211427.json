months), each labeled with average temperature in °F (e.g., Apr 47°, May 62°, ..., Apr 43°).\n\nData Points :\n  • Each bar represents a month, with the following approximate values (from left to right):\n    – Apr (47°): ~470 kWh/day\n    – May (62°): ~500 kWh/day\n    – Jun (67°): ~630 kWh/day\n    – Jul (74°): ~670 kWh/day\n    – Aug (75°): ~680 kWh/day\n    – Sep (63°): ~640 kWh/day\n    –

is shown below the month label.\n\nDistribution & Trends :\n  • Electric usage increases from April, peaking in July and August, then gradually decreases.\n  • Usage is relatively stable and lower from November through March.\n  • The green bar for the final April matches the lower usage months.\n\nAnalysis :\n  • Electric usage is highest during the summer months (June–August) when average temperatures are highest.\n  • Usage is lowest and stable during the colder months (November–March), despite lower average temperatures.\n  • The pattern suggests increased electricity consumption during warmer months, likely due to cooling needs, and relatively steady usage during cooler months.","grounding":[{"page":0,"box":{"l":0.045291513204574585,"t":0.18041686713695526,"r":0.4247957766056061,"b":0.4381674528121948},"image_path":null}],"chunk_type":"figure","chunk_id":"34598315-754a-435a-a13e-96d343845b81"},{"text":"Summary
