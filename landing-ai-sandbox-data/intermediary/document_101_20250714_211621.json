HISTORY\".\n  • X-axis: Months (OCT, NOV, DEC, JAN, FEB, MAR, APR, MAY, JUN, JUL, AUG, SEP, OCT).\n  • Y-axis: Consumption (units not specified), ranging from 0 to 1,250,000 with tick marks at 0, 312,500, 625,000, 937,500, and 1,250,000.\n\nData Points :\n  • Bars represent monthly consumption values for each month from October (previous year) to October (current year).\n  • The current month (October, rightmost bar) is highlighted in a darker blue.\n  • Approximate bar heights (in Y-axis units, estimated visually):\n    – FEB: ~700,000\n    – MAR: ~675,000\n    – APR: ~725,000\n    – MAY: ~800,000\n    – JUN: ~1,050,000 (peak)\n    – JUL: ~900,000\n    – AUG: ~950,000\n    – SEP: ~925,000\n    – OCT (current): ~850,000\n  • No bars are shown for NOV, DEC, JAN (possibly missing data or zero).\n\nDesign Encodings :\n  • All bars are light blue except the current month (October), which is dark blue.\n  • Horizontal gridlines for easier reading of values.\n  • Bolded label for the current month on the X-axis.\n  • Note below chart: \"Current month's reading is Highlighted.\"\n\nDistribution & Trends :\n  • Consumption is relatively stable from February to May, then peaks sharply in June.\n  • After June, consumption decreases but remains higher than earlier months.\n  • The current month (October) is lower than the peak but higher than the early months.\n\nAnalysis :\n  • The data shows a clear seasonal or periodic peak in June, with consumption rising steadily from February, peaking in June, and then declining but staying elevated through October.\n  • The current month's consumption is above the early-year values but below the annual maximum.\n  • The absence of bars for November, December, and January suggests missing data or no consumption recorded for those months.","grounding":[{"page":0,"box":{"l":0.05680727958679199,"t":0.46699845790863037,"r":0.5148760080337524,"b":0.6367191076278687},"image_path":null}],"chunk_type":"figure","chunk_id":"a778856a-5c07-4dfd-89fc-f8e5556bc98e"},{"text":"MONTHLY
