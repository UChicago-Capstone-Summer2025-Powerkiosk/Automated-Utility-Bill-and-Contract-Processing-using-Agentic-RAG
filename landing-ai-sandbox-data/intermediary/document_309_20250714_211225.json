context is \"Current Charges for Electricity\".\n  • X-axis: Dollar amount ($0 to $50, tick marks at $0, $10, $20, $30, $40, $50).\n  • Y-axis: Not labeled; single bar represents total delivery cost.\n  • No series legend; two categories are described in text: \"Supply\" and \"Delivery\".\n\n# Data Points :\n  • Supply: $0.31 (cost of electricity from NEXTERA ENERGY SERVICES CONN).\n  • Delivery: $44.04 (cost to deliver electricity from Eversource).\n  • Bar visually represents the delivery cost, extending to just past $44 on the x-axis; supply cost is not visually represented as a bar.\n\n# Design Encodings :\n  • Delivery cost bar is filled in green.\n  • Supply and delivery costs are highlighted in blue and green text, respectively.\n  • Additional supplier information and approval annotations are present below the chart but are not part of the data visualization.\n\n# Analysis :\n  • The delivery cost ($44.04) vastly exceeds the supply cost ($0.31), as visually emphasized by the long green bar for delivery and the near absence of a bar for supply.\n  • The figure highlights that the majority of the electricity bill is due to delivery charges rather than the cost of the electricity itself.\n  • No trends or distributions are present, as this is a single-period cost breakdown. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.460,t=0.180,r=0.969,b=0.573), with ID 3b2e0d26-6d72-45bc-9a11-bfaad029d551 -->\n\nSummary : This figure provides a summary of electric usage for the current month, including average daily use, year-over-year comparison, and a visual indicator of usage change.\n\ninfographic:\nOverall Layout :\n  • Three main sections: (1) average daily use, (2) year-over-year usage comparison, (3) circular usage change indicator.\n  • Blue header labeled \"Electric Usage Summary\".\n\nAverage Daily Use :\n  • Text: \"This month your average daily use was less than 0.1 kWh\".\n  • \"0.1 kWh\" is highlighted in blue.\n\nYear-over-Year Comparison :\n  • Text: \"This month your usage stayed the same compared to same time last year.\"\n\nUsage Change Indicator :\n  • Large green circle with \"0%\" in the center.\n  • Below \"0%\", the word \"USAGE\" and a downward green arrow.\n\nDesign Encodings :\n  • Blue and green color palette.\n  • Key numbers and terms highlighted for emphasis.\n  • Circular graphic for visual impact.\n\nAnalysis :\n  • The household's electric usage is extremely low (less than 0.1 kWh per day).\n  • There is no change (0%) in usage compared to the same month last year, as indicated by both text and the green arrow.\n  • The visual layout emphasizes stability and minimal consumption. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.045,t=0.445,r=0.427,b=0.565), with ID 491d6db5-02fa-497b-8345-23df0cb806bf -->\n\nNews For You\n\nA new discount for electric bills is available if you have a financial hardship status on your electric account.
