Customer shall provide to Company written notice of any such proposed change reasonably in advance. The following provisions apply to each such change:
(i) If the Net Change results in an increase or decrease of the remaining Expected Usage amounts by an amount not exceeding the Covered Bandwidth, as reasonably estimated by Company, the Parties will amend Addendum A to reflect the change to the ESI IDs and use commercially reasonable efforts to implement such amendment.
(ii) If the Net Change results in an increase in the remaining Expected Usage amounts by an amount greater than the Covered Bandwidth, as reasonably estimated by Company, Company will, at its discretion, offer to Customer a new unit price applicable to the ESI IDs being added, which price will be the Holdover Price if added during the Holdover Period. In such event, no ESI IDs will be added unless and until the Parties agree to such new unit price and this Agreement is amended.
(iii) If the Net Change results in a decrease in the remaining Expected Usage amounts by an amount greater than the Covered Bandwidth (such greater amount being the "Excess Decrease"), as reasonably estimated by Company, Company will allow each ESI ID contributing to the Excess Decrease to be deleted without an amendment to this Agreement; provided, however, Customer shall pay Company the Early Termination Fee plus any amounts due to

Company with respect to each such deleted ESI ID, as invoiced by Company through the deletion date (date of switch or disconnection, as applicable).
(iv) "Covered Bandwidth" means an amount equal to Ten Percent (10\%) of Expected Usage.
(v) "Expected Usage" means the total electricity usage of the original ESI IDs listed as of the Effective Date forecasted by Company as of the Effective Date.
(vi) "Net Change" means the positive or negative amount of energy usage which results from Company's reasonable estimate of (a) the proposed addition and/or deletion of ESI IDs, and (b) all previous additions and/or deletions of ESI IDs, if any.

# State-Required Acknowledgement of Risk 

## (Market Energy Index and Holdover Pricing)

Customer hereby agrees and acknowledges that the unit price charged with respect to the ESI IDs will be based on ERCOT wholesale energy prices in these cases: during the Initial Term, Customer pays Gexa Energy the Energy Price (per unit) under an energy index or market price structure (which includes Gexa Energy's Market Energy Index product); and/or after the end of the Initial Term, Customer pays Gexa Energy the Holdover Price (per unit) as defined in the TOS.

Accordingly, the undersigned, for himself/herself or on behalf of Customer, hereby acknowledges and agrees as follows: I understand that the volatility and fluctuation of wholesale energy pricing may cause my energy bill to be multiple times higher in a month in which wholesale energy prices are high. I understand that I will be responsible for charges caused by fluctuations in wholesale energy prices.

## (Ancillary Service Charges)

If costs and charges for Market-Based Ancillary Services and/or Non-Market-Based Ancillary Services are PassThrough Charges for which Customer is required to pay, Customer hereby agrees and acknowledges that such costs and charges are variable and potentially volatile.

I understand that the volatility and fluctuation of costs and charges for Market-Based Ancillary Services and/or Non-Market-Based Ancillary Services, if Pass-Through Charges, may cause my energy bill to be multiple times higher in a month in which these costs and charges are high. I understand that in all cases I will be responsible for charges caused by fluctuations in costs and charges for Market-Based Ancillary Services and/or Non-Market-Based Ancillary Services.

2. ELECTRIC SUPPLY. During the Initial Term and any Holdover Period, Company shall supply Customer's full electricity requirements for the ESI ID(s), and Customer shall obtain its full electricity requirements for such ESI ID(s) exclusively from Company, all based on the terms and conditions specified in this Agreement. Subject to terms and conditions of this Agreement, Company shall cause electricity to be delivered to the Delivery Point(s) and Customer shall receive such electricity at the Delivery Point(s). Notwithstanding the foregoing, Company shall be under no obligation to supply any ESI IDs under a residential rate class and, if Company does supply such ESI IDs, Customer hereby represents and warrants to Company that such ESI IDs are used for commercial or governmental purposes.
3. CUSTOMER INFORMATION. Customer hereby authorizes Company to obtain or access from the Utility and/or Customer current and historical electricity cost and usage data of Customer, Customer's payment and credit history, and other information generally relevant to the supply and associated services to be supplied under this Agreement. Customer agrees to provide additional documentation regarding such authorization as requested by Company. Customer agrees, upon request, to provide Company with facility descriptions, operating information, meter identification numbers and locations, and such other information available to Customer as Company may reasonably required to provide electric supply and other applicable products and services pursuant to this Agreement. Customer's

expected energy usage for the ESI IDs may change for various reasons including, without limitation, additional equipment going on-line, ramp-up in equipment use, equipment modifications, increasing operating hours, remodel of facilities, new construction, applications for new construction permits, participation in demand response programs, participation in special government electricity supply programs or on-site electric generation of any type or size. Customer shall provide Company at least thirty (30) days' advance notice whenever it believes that it will experience a "MC Event," as defined below, and shall provide good faith estimates of the associated usage change. As used in this Agreement, a "MC Event" is deemed to have occurred when the monthly aggregate usage of the ESI IDs, for two (2) or more consecutive months, is either less than eighty percent ( $80 \%$ ) or greater than one hundred twenty ( $120 \%$ ) of the usage for such months reasonably expected by Company. Irrespective of whether Customer has provided notice to Company, Customer shall pay Company, as Pass-Through Charges, the full amount of any losses, and/or new or increased costs and charges, reasonably associated with each MC Event.
4. ENROLLMENT. Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to timely enroll Customer's ESI ID(s) with the Utility in accordance with the intended Service Commencement Date. Company's submission of market orders may be delayed due to events beyond its reasonable control including, but not limited to, submission of an incomplete, improperly completed, unclear, inaccurate or improper form of BEA by or on behalf of Customer, as reasonably determined by Company. Customer agrees to take steps to cooperate with Company's efforts to perform enrollment of ESI IDs for supply under this Agreement. Customer understands the Utility determines final enrollment and agrees that Company is not liable for any delay or failure in enrolling Customer's ESI ID(s) if such delay or failure is due to incorrect ESI ID information, invalid ESI ID numbers, and/or any other cause beyond Company's control. Further, notwithstanding any provision in the Agreement to the contrary, it is possible that for various reasons such as the ESI ID not existing, ESI ID not active, ESI ID is not the "first in" and/or a required permit for the ESI ID is not valid with the Utility, some or all the ESI IDs cannot be enrolled. All such un-enrolled ESI IDs shall be automatically deleted from the list of ESI IDs under this Agreement without an amendment to this Agreement. Company has the right to treat one or more failures to enroll any ESI IDs as an early termination of this Agreement. If one or more ESI IDs fail to enroll on a timely basis based on inaccurate information from Customer and/or any other cause beyond Company's control, Customer may, at the option of Company, be required to pay Company the Early Termination Fee due with respect to such ESI IDs. Company is not required to serve any such un-enrolled ESI IDs.
5. TERM OF AGREEMENT. This Agreement shall become effective on the Effective Date, with service commencing for each respective ESI ID(s) on the Service Commencement Date, and shall continue for the Initial Term. After the Initial Term expires, this Agreement shall continue on a month-to-month basis at the Holdover Price unless and until either Party terminates this Agreement by providing reasonable advance notice provided to the other Party. The termination date with respect to each ESI ID is the date following the date of such notice where the ESI ID has been successfully switched by the Utility to another REP. During and after the end of any Holdover Period, Customer is responsible for all amounts due to Company under this Agreement.
6. PRICING. The Energy Price and/or Retail Adder for electric supply provided to Customer by Company during the Initial Term is set forth in the Agreement and subject to any adjustments set forth in this Agreement. Customer pays all Pass-Through Charges. Certain Pass-Through Charges imposed during the Initial Term may be set forth in the BEA or any addendum to this Agreement. Pass-Through Charges are charges to Customer, not credits. The unit price for electricity during the Holdover Period is the Holdover Price, not the Price. The Holdover Price is a variable price. The Holdover Price will change without prior notice to Customer. In some cases, the Holdover Price may vary significantly from the Price charged during the Initial Term of this Agreement. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, during the Holdover Period, Customer shall pay Company as Pass-Through Charges all costs and charges for electric energy components including, without limitation, Market-Based Ancillary Services, Non-Market Based Ancillary Services, PUCT and ERCOT fees, Securitization Uplift Charge, hub to load zone basis, transmission and distribution losses, UFE line losses, and renewable energy credits for state renewable portfolio standards.
7. BILLING AND PAYMENT - GOVERNMENT ENTITIES. Customer shall pay the full amount of each bill issued under this Agreement. Each bill will consist of the Monthly Charge, or multiple Monthly Charges if Company defers Monthly Charges as provided below. Customer shall pay Company the amount due under each monthly bill. Customer represents and warrants to Company that it is a "government entity" as defined in the Prompt Payment Act (Tex. Government Code, Chapter 2251), as amended ("PPA"). A payment by Customer shall become overdue as provided in the PPA. Further, billing disputes shall be resolved as provided in the PPA, and interest on overdue payments shall be calculated and remitted in accordance with the PPA. Company has the right to assess such interest on overdue payments and has the right to report delinquent balances to a credit agency.

Company may elect to defer sending monthly bills for all periods where actual usage is not available from the Utility. If the Utility fails to timely obtain or transmit a meter reading, Company reserves the right to issue or cause to be issued a bill to Customer based on its estimated Energy Usage and charges during the Billing Cycle. Company will include or cause to be included in any subsequent bill from Company, adjustments related to previous billings, including estimates, previous billing errors, meter read errors, or other errors or omissions.

Company may apply any credit balance on a particular ESI ID to a balance owed on any other Customer ESI ID. Further, Company has the right to set off any amounts owed by Company to Customer under this Agreement against any amounts owed by Customer to Company or its affiliates. If one or more Pass-Through Charges are involved in deferred billing, Company has the right to estimate the Pass-Through Charges on the bills in the interim and Customer shall pay Company such estimated Pass-Through Charges. Company may assess a twenty five dollar (\$25) fee against any transaction not processed due to insufficient funds or credit availability for any method of payment, including checks, bank drafts or credit card.

If Customer's account(s) is under a deferred payment plan with Company and Customer has not paid the amount due by the payment date, such account(s) may be placed on a "switch-hold." If a "switch-hold" is placed on such account(s), Customer will not be able to switch Customer's electric service to another REP until the Customer has paid in full the outstanding balance due.
8. CREDIT AND DEPOSIT REQUIREMENTS. If Company determines, prior to offering service or at any time during the term of this Agreement, that Customer cannot demonstrate satisfactory creditworthiness, Customer has failed to timely pay all amounts due under this Agreement or there otherwise exists an Event of Default with respect to Customer under this Agreement, Company has the right to require Customer to either make advanced payments or provide to Company performance assurance to ensure prompt and timely payments of amounts due to Company under this Agreement. If, after Customer has been required to make advanced payments or provide performance assurance, Company determines that Customer's credit is unsatisfactory, Company has the right to require Customer to provide additional performance assurance. Customer shall post with Company any performance assurance within three (3) days after the date on which Company made a demand for initial or additional performance assurance. The amount and form of initial or additional performance assurance will be determined by Company in a commercially reasonable manner.
9. TERMINATION OF AGREEMENT. If Customer commits or is otherwise subject to an Event of Default in whole or with respect to one or more ESI IDs then, in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other remedy Company may have in law or equity, Company has the right to terminate this Agreement. Company has the right to terminate this Agreement in whole, or in part as to any affected ESI ID(s), as determined solely by the Company. If the Agreement is so terminated by Company, Customer shall pay Company for all amounts owed up to the date of such termination including, without limitation, all electricity supplied, any other products and services provided to Customer through the date of such termination, and any interest due. Further, Customer shall pay Company the sum of any Costs plus the Early Termination Fee. In addition, if an Early Supply Switch occurs without Company receiving at least thirty (30) days' advance notice from Customer, Customer shall pay Company the Insufficient Notice Fee. Company will not be required to enter into any replacement transaction in order to determine Costs or the Early Termination Fee. The Parties agree that the amounts recoverable hereunder are a reasonable estimate of loss and not a penalty.
9. TITLE AND RISK OF LOSS. Title and risk of loss to the electricity sold under this Agreement passes from Company to Customer when the electricity is delivered to the Delivery Point for each ESI ID(s). Customer agrees that Company does not control the physical electricity sold under this Agreement, which electricity flows through the Utility transmission and/or delivery systems, and accordingly, Company shall not be responsible for any failure in the Utility transmission or delivery system.
10. FORCE MAJEURE. Company will be excused from performance of its obligations under this Agreement, in whole or in part, to the extent caused by or related to an event of Force Majeure.
11. CHANGE IN LAW. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, if there is one or more Change in Law events and such event, either independently or in conjunction with one or more other events (including, without limitation an auction), results in Company incurring new or increased costs or charges related to providing retail electric supply or any other products or services under this Agreement, Customer shall pay Company such new or increased costs and charges as Pass-Through Charges. In calculating each such charge, if the increase is not reasonably evident from the Change in Law itself, or if the charges subsequently increase based on another event,

Company may calculate the increase based on the charge incurred after the Change in Law event as compared to Company's earlier estimates of the charge.
12. NON-DISCRIMINATION. Company does not discriminate against any Customer based wholly or partly on race, color, creed, national origin, or sex, of an applicant for service or for any arbitrary, capricious, or unfairly discriminatory reason.

Customer represents, warrants and agrees that (i) it has appropriated sufficient funds to pay all amounts due to Company for all ESI IDs during Customer's current fiscal period; (ii) Customer reasonably believes that legally available funds in an amount sufficient to make all such payments for the for the full multi-year term can be obtained; and (iii) Customer intends to make a good faith effort to obtain and maintain funds from which all such payments to become due during the full multi-year term of the Agreement, including making provision for such payments to the extent necessary in each budget or appropriation request submitted and adopted in accordance with applicable law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if sufficient funds are not available to Customer to make all payments and pay other amounts due with respect to one or more ESI IDs, and to become due, from Customer, then Customer may, subject to the terms hereof, terminate the Agreement with respect to the affected ESI IDs as of the last day of the fiscal period for which appropriations were received (an "Event of Non-appropriation"). Customer agrees, however, to pay for all electricity supplied by Company prior to the day of termination of this Agreement due to Customer's non-appropriation.

Customer further agrees to deliver notice of each Event of Non-appropriation to Company at least 90 days prior to the end of the Customer's current fiscal period, or if an Event of Non-appropriation has not occurred by that date, promptly upon the occurrence of any such Event of Non-appropriation (a "Non-Appropriations Notice"). Customer's obligation to make payment and pay other amounts due under the Agreement shall constitute a current expense and shall not, in any way, be construed to be a debt in contravention of any applicable constitutional or statutory limitations or requirements concerning Customer's creation of indebtedness, nor shall anything contained herein constitute a pledge of the Customer's general tax revenues, funds or monies.

Customer agrees that, if any funds are appropriated or allocated for electricity costs for the ESI IDs covered by this Agreement for periods during the Initial Term or any Holdover Period, such funds shall be applied first to the payments to be made to Company for electricity and related services provided under this Agreement and that any such funds shall not be used to pay for electricity from any other REP during the Initial Term or any Holdover Period for the ESI IDs covered by this Agreement.

Additionally, upon the delivery of any such Non-Appropriations Notice, Company shall have a right to calculate any Early Termination Fee resulting from the inability to sell to Customer the remaining expected volume of electricity under this Agreement. Then, subject to the laws of the State and Texas Constitution, if Customer subsequently appropriates funds for electricity for one or more of the ESI IDs covered by this Agreement, regardless of the delivery date, all such appropriated funds shall be paid to Company without Company providing Customer any notice or demand for any such Early Termination Fee, until Company is paid in full.

Company shall have the right, at its sole expense and during Customer's normal business hours, to examine the records of Customer to the extent reasonably necessary to verify the accuracy of any Non-Appropriations Notice or the appropriation of funds subsequent to any such Non-Appropriations Notice. Company will notify Customer with written notice thirty (30) days in advance of the Company's proposed date to visit Customer's location to examine such records. If any such examination reveals any inaccuracy on any Non-Appropriations Notice or the representation by Customer that no funds have been allocated subsequent to any such Non-Appropriations Notice, the necessary adjustments for any delinquent payments shall be made within thirty (30) days of resolution of the inaccuracy and any payments due shall be made to Company. The foregoing right to examine will survive any expiration or sooner termination of the Agreement for a period of twenty-four (24) months from the date of such expiration or sooner termination. Out of abundance of caution and for absolute clarity this Section does not authorize Customer to terminate this Agreement to obtain electric supply, electricity components REC Product and/or any services at a lower rate, price and/or fee than Company charges under this Agreement. Customer is entering this Agreement subject to the Texas Local Government Code, Title 8, Sub-Title C, Chapter 271, Subchapter A, Public Property Finance Act.
