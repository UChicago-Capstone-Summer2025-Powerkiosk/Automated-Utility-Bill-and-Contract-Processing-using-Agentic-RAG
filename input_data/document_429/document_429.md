## Your electricity charges

These charges are for the electricity you used (supply) and getting that electricity to you (delivery). Rates are based on a 30 day period. When your billing period is more or less than 30 days, we prorate your bill accordingly.

## Electricity you used during this 32 day billing period from Dec 06, 2019 to Jan 7, 2020

Rate: EL9 General Large
We measure your electricity by how many kilowatt hours (KWh) you use. One KWh will light a 100 watt bulb for 10 hours. The meter multiplier is the factor by which the meter difference is multiplied to determine your usage. Demand or kW is the highest amount of electric usage in any half hour during the bill period. Reactive-Power charges are measured in excess kVar above $95 \%$ power factor. Your total electricity use is the sum of the usage from your various meters as shown in the meter detail section of your bill starting on page 3.
