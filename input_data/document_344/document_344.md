Smell. Leave. Call. Know what to do if you smell gas. Natural gas has a distinctive odor that smells like rotten eggs. If you smell gas, leave the area immediately. Call 911 or PSE\&G at 800-880-PSEG (7734). Do not assume somebody else has already called. For more information, visit pseg.com/smeligas.

Smart meters are safe, and will provide our electric customers with many benefits. They use low power radio frequency (RF) that is generally far less than that used by everyday items like baby monitors, cell phones, microwaves, TVs and wireless routers. To learn more, go to pseg.com/smartmeters.

When you see our crews in the street installing new gas pipes, please pardon any inconvenience. We're working hard to make sure our gas system is upgraded to safely and reliably provide you with heat and hot water now and in the future. For a list of towns and streets where the work is taking place, go to pseg.com/gaswork.
