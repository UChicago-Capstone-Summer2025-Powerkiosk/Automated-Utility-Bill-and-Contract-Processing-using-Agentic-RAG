3. Purchase Price: Buyer will pay the Purchase Price stated in each Transaction Confirmation. If the Purchase Price incorporates an index and the index is not announced or published on any day for any reason or if the Seller reasonably determines that a material change in the formula for or the method of determining the Purchase Price has occurred, then the Parties will use a commercially reasonable replacement price that is calculated by the Seller. If Seller concludes that a change in any Law(s) increases Seller's costs, the Purchase Price may be adjusted by Seller to reflect such costs. "Law(s)" mean all tariffs, laws, orders, rules, decisions, taxes, regulations, transmission rates, and Utility changes to Buyer's monthly capacity and/or transmission obligations.

"Material Usage Deviation" means any deviation in Actual Quantity at the Service Location (s) slated in the related Transaction Confirmation from Contract Quantity (or, as applicable, estimated Contract Quantities) stated in that Transaction Confirmation of +/- $25 \%$ or more, which is not caused by weather.

10. Financial Responsibility: Seller's entry into this Agreement and each Transaction is conditioned on Buyer, its parent, any guarantor or any successor maintaining its creditworthiness during the Delivery Period and any Renewal Term. When Seller has reasonable grounds for insecurity regarding Buyer's ability or willingness to perform all of its outstanding obligations under any agreement between the Parties, Seller may require Buyer to provide adequate assurance, which may include, in the Seller's discretion, security in the form of cash deposits, prepayments, letters of credit or other guaranty of payment or performance ("Credit Assurance").

Any Net Settlement Amount due from the defaulting Party to the non-defaulting Party will be paid within three (3) Business Days of written notice from the non-defaulting Party. Interest on any unpaid portion of the Net Settlement Amount will accrue daily at the Interest Rate. "Close-out Value" is the sum of (a) the amount due to the non-defaulting Party regarding the Contract Quantities (or, as applicable, estimated Contract Quantities) remaining to be delivered as stated in the applicable Transaction Confirmation(s) during the Delivery Period or, if applicable, the current Renewal Term, calculated by determining the difference between the Purchase Price and the Market Price for such quantities; and (b) without duplication, any net losses or costs incurred by the non-defaulting Party for terminating the Transaction(s), including costs of obtaining, maintaining and/or liquidating commercially reasonable hedges, Balancing Charges and/or transaction costs. "Market Price" means the price for similar quantities of Commodity at the Delivery Point during the Delivery Period or Renewal Term, as applicable. For purposes of determining Close-out Value, (i) Market Price will be determined by the non-defaulting Party in

good faith as of a date and time as close as reasonably practical to the date and time of termination or liquidation of the applicable Transaction(s), and (ii) Market Price may be ascertained through reference to quotations provided by recognized energy brokers or dealers, market indices, bona-fide offers from third-parties, or by reference to commercially reasonable forward pricing valuations. The Parties agree that the Close-out Value constitutes a reasonable approximation of damages, and is not a penalty or punitive in any respect. Seller may, but need not, physically liquidate a Transaction or enter into a replacement transaction to determine Close-out Value or Net Settlement Amount. The defaulting Party is responsible for all costs and fees incurred for collection of Net Settlement Amount, including, reasonable attorney's fees and expert witness fees.
