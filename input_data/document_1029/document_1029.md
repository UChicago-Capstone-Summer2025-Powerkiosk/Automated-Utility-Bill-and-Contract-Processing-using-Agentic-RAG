## Important to know

## Your next meter reading: Jun 27

Please be sure we can safely access your meter for actual readings. Don't worry if your digital meter flashes eights from time to time. That's a normal part of the energy measuring process.

## Your service(s) may be disconnected if your payment is past due

If payment for your service(s) is past due, we may begin disconnection procedures. If your service is disconnected because of a missed payment, you must pay the amount specified in the Important
Disconnect Information section on your bill, as well as, a reconnection fee, before your service will be reconnected. The reconnection fee is $\$ 10$ for electric service that may be reconnected remotely, $\$ 69$ for electric service that is not eligible to be reconnected remotely, and $\$ 17$ for gas service. In such situations where both electric and gas service are disconnected for non-payment, the reconnection fee will not exceed $\$ 27$ for both.

## Failure to pay may result in a return to our standard offer for generation

Failure to pay charges for a competitive retail service may result in cancellation of your contract with the respective retail electric supplier. You will then be returned to Duke Energy Ohio's standard offer for generation services.

## When you pay by check

We may process the payment as a regular check or convert it into a one-time electronic check payment.

Customer Charge - The fixed monthly charge covers the cost of providing service to your location as well as maintaining customer records, billing and transactions affecting your account.

Delivery Charge - Charges for the operating expenses and delivering energy.

Generation Charge - Charges associated with the production of electricity.

The image is a combination of a graph and tabular data.

The graph is a line chart titled "Gas usage history" with the y-axis labeled "CCF" and values ranging from 0 to 20689. The x-axis shows months from May to May, indicating a yearly usage breakdown (monthly-based). The line represents data for the years 2021 and 2022, with a notable increase in usage starting from October and peaking in January, followed by a decline.

Below the graph, there is a table with the heading "Average temperature in degrees" showing temperatures for each month, ranging from 30° to 75°.

Another table titled "Current Electric Usage" is divided into sections:
