## TERMS AND CONDITIONS

1. Constellation Services. I want Constellation NewEnergy - Gas Division, LLC ("Constellation") to supply all the natural gas I need to heat my business and for other related uses. Constellation may cancel this Agreement if my usage of gas changes substantially, which shall be defined as an absolute variance of twenty (20) percent or more (exclusive of any expected weather impact) from the previous twelve (12) months' usage for each respective month. I am 18 years of age or older, and I am fully authorized to enter into this Agreement. These terms and conditions, the Enrollment Form or Welcome Letter, and any Renewal Notice (if applicable) reflect my entire Agreement with Constellation ("Agreement") and supersede any oral or written agreements made in connection with this Agreement or my natural gas supply.
2. Local Utility Services. My utility will continue to deliver gas to me, read my meter, and provide emergency and other services it has provided in the past. The natural gas I buy from Constellation will be included in my utility monthly bill or in a separate bill from Constellation.
3. Term. My supply will begin on the day that my utility switches my account to Constellation and will continue for the term indicated in my Enrollment Form or Welcome Letter. This Agreement is subject to the eligibility requirements of my utility, and Constellation may choose not to accept this contract for any reason.
4. Rate. Each month I will pay my bill for my natural gas, which will be calculated by multiplying (i) the rate charged per therm of gas as indicated on my Enrollment form or Welcome Letter by (ii) the amount of gas used in the billing cycle plus (iii) any applicable fees associated with my rate plan plus (iv) applicable taxes, fees, and charges levied by the utility for distribution and other services. This rate may be higher or lower than the utility's rate in any given month. If I am receiving a separate bill from Constellation for my natural gas I will also pay a monthly customer service fee not to exceed $\$ 5.95$.
5. Administration Fee. A customer administration charge in the amount listed on my Enrollment Form or Welcome Letter will be added to the monthly bill for natural gas if applicable.
6. Renewal Notice; Notification of Changes. At least 30 days prior to the termination date, Constellation, in its discretion, may offer to renew my contract by mailing me written notification on the same or different conditions, in which case my contract shall automatically renew consistent with the conditions indicated in the notice unless I notify Constellation otherwise prior to the termination of my current Agreement with Constellation. If the renewal notice indicates that this Contract will be renewed at a Monthly Variable Price, the Monthly Variable Price will be set in Constellation's discretion and may vary from month to month based on Constellation's assessment of applicable market conditions, historic and projected supply and hedging costs, prior months pricing and balancing costs, projected average customer bill amounts and utility pricing. My Monthly Variable Price may include the following additional costs: balancing costs, transportation costs, line loss costs, storage costs, pooling charges, credit costs and a profit margin determined in Constellation's discretion that may vary from month to month.
7. Termination. My Agreement with Constellation may be cancelled as follows:

- If I am a commercial customer who consumes more than 5,000 therms annually, the cost recovery fee will be the greater of $\$ 150$ or the amount of gas I failed to consume during the remainder of my fixed term, calculated on the basis of prior usage, multiplied by the excess, if any, of my Fixed Rate over the rate at which Constellation can sell such gas at the time of my termination. The cost recovery fee is not a penalty, but compensates Constellation for the cost of buying gas in advance on my behalf.
- If the Illinois Commerce Commission ("ICC") or my utility decides to end or change the program under which I buy gas, Constellation may cancel this contract upon 30 days advance written notice.
- If I fail to pay my natural gas bill in a timely manner my utility may terminate my eligibility for the Select Program and Constellation may terminate this Agreement.
- If I move to a location outside the state of Illinois, or to a location without a transportation service program, or to a location where I do not require gas service, I may cancel this Agreement without penalty.

8. Bill Payment. Constellation may bill me directly and separately from my utility. If I do not pay my bill on time, I will be subject to a late payment fee for undisputed amounts in the amount of $1.5 \%$ per month, and collection costs incurred due to my late payment or nonpayment. If Customer, in good faith, disputes the amount of any such invoice or any part thereof, Customer will pay such amount as it concedes to be correct; provided, however, if Customer disputes the amount due, it must provide supporting documentation acceptable in industry practice to support the amount paid or disputed. In the event the Parties are unable to resolve such dispute, either Party may pursue any remedy available at law or in equity to enforce its rights pursuant to this Section 8. All returned checks will be subject to the maximum fee allowed by law. If I fail to pay my bill, Constellation may cancel our Agreement by providing me with 15 days written notice.
9. Dispute Resolution. Constellation will refer all complaints to a person who will acknowledge them promptly and work out a mutually satisfactory resolution. If I am still unhappy, I may contact a Constellation supervisor by calling (855) 465-1244, who will respond to me promptly. If my questions are not resolved after I have called Constellation, I may call the ICC toll free at (800) 524-0795 or TTY at (800) 858-9277, from 8:30 A.M. to 5:00 P.M. - weekdays, visit the ICC website at www.icc.illinois.gov or as otherwise specified by the commission.
