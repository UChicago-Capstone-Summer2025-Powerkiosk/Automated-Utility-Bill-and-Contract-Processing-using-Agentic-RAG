# News For You 

Beginning Jan. 1, if you've chosen Eversource as your energy supplier, the Standard Service supply rate will increase compared to December. This is consistent with the typical summer to winter upward adjustment. The price of energy from power generators usually increases in the winter due to the demand for natural gas, which is used for heating and to produce roughly half of New England's electricity. To learn about programs we offer to manage your energy use and help you pay your bill this winter, visit Eversource.com/winter-bill.
