## Constellation NewEnergy, Inc. Electricity Supply Agreement - Fixed Price Solutions

## MIDSTATE MANUFACTURING COMPANY ("Customer") AND Constellation NewEnergy, Inc. ("Seller") AGREE AS FOLLOWS:

Defined Terms. Capitalized terms have the meanings set out in this Electricity Supply Agreement, including the attached General Terms and Conditions ("Agreement"); generally the words "you" and "your" refer to the Customer listed above and the words "we" and "us" refer to Seller, unless the context clearly requires otherwise.

Purchase and Sale of Electricity. You will purchase and receive, and we will sell and supply all of your electricity requirements at the prices set forth below for each account identified in the Account Schedule below ("Account"). By signing this Agreement, you authorize us to enroll each Account with your UDC so that we can supply those Account(s). You will take such actions as we request to allow us to enroll each Account in a timely manner. You agree that we may select such sources of energy as we deem appropriate to meet our obligations under this Agreement. We will enroll each Account with the applicable UDC as being supplied by us and will take such other actions with the applicable UDC and ISO necessary for us to meet our obligations under this Agreement.

The specific prices for each Account are set forth in the Account Schedule, below. You are also responsible to pay (1) Taxes - which we will pass through to you on your bill or as part of the price of electricity, as may be required by law, rule or regulation and (2) UDC charges for delivery/distribution services if we provide you a single bill that includes UDC charges. We will apply all appropriate Taxes unless and until you provide a valid certification of tax exempt status. Your prices are fixed for the existing term of this Agreement and only subject to change if there is a change in law, as described in Section 5 of the General Terms and Conditions below. The UDC charges (if any) and Taxes are charged to you as a "pass-through," which means they will change during the existing term of this Agreement if and as the related charges assessed or charged vary for any reason, including but not limited to the types of changes described above.

Cost Components. For each of the items listed as "Fixed" below, this means the item is included in your contract prices as set forth in the Account Schedule. For each of the items listed as "Passed Through" below, this means that you will be charged the costs associated with the line item in accordance with the definitions of each item in Section 1 Definitions of the General Terms and Conditions.

| Energy Costs | Fixed |
| :-- | :-- |
| Ancillary Services And Other ISO Costs | Fixed |
| Capacity Costs | Fixed |
| Transmission Costs | Fixed |
| Line Loss Costs | Fixed |
| FERC Order 745 Costs | Passed Through |
| MTEP Costs | Fixed |
| MVP Costs | Fixed |

The contract prices contained in the Account Schedule have been reduced to reflect a fixed credit to you for the Auction Revenue Rights and Transmission Loss Credits associated with the Account(s). Any applicable RMR Costs will be passed through to you. The contract prices also include any credit costs, and margin.
Renewable Portfolio Standards Costs ("RPS Costs"). Pursuant to the Future Energy Jobs Bill (Illinois Public Act 099-0906) charges for RPS Costs are now collected as UDC Delivery Charges ("RPS UDC Charges"). If during the term of this Agreement, some or all of the RPS UDC Charges are no longer invoiced as UDC Delivery Charges, Seller will pass those charges through to Customer.

Retail Trade Transactions. At any time during the term of this Agreement, you may request the purchase of renewable energy certificates in an amount equal to a prescribed percentage of your load volume by entering into one or more Retail Trade Transactions ("RTTs") between us. If we both agree to the pricing and terms of the renewable energy certificates purchase, a separate RTT Confirmation signed by both of us will document each such purchase and be incorporated herein.

Term. This Agreement will become effective and binding after you have signed this Agreement and we have counter-signed. Subject to successful enrollment of your Account(s), this Agreement shall commence on or about the date set forth under "Start Date" and end on or about the date set forth under "End Date", unless extended on a holdover basis as described in this Agreement. The actual Start Date is dependent on the UDC successfully enrolling the Account(s) and furnishing us with all necessary information regarding the Account(s) meter read cycle and meter read date(s). The dates set forth in the Account Schedule below reflect UDC information available at that time or as otherwise estimated by us. The actual meter read dates may occur on or about the dates set forth herein. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to begin service to each Account(s) on the actual meter read date on or about the Start Date set forth herein. If we are unable to timely enroll an Account, the Start Date will commence on the next regularly scheduled UDC meter read cycle date following successful enrollment. The End Date will remain the same unless extended for a holdover term. We shall not be liable for any failure to enroll or drop an Account by the Start and End Date due to circumstances beyond our control. We will not be responsible for any gaps in service that may occur between the termination of your service from a prior supplier and the commencement of supply from us.

Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to require or otherwise obligate us to offer to extend the term of this Agreement. If following termination or expiration of this Agreement (whether in whole or in part), for any reason, some or all of the Accounts remain designated by the UDC as being supplied by us, we may continue to serve such Account(s) on a month-to-month holdover basis. During such holdover term, we will calculate your invoice as follows: (Each Account's metered usage, as adjusted by the applicable line loss factor) times (the applicable ISO-published Day Ahead Locational Based Marginal Price ("LMP") $+\$ .015000 / \mathrm{kWh})+$ (a pass through of all costs and charges incurred for the retail delivery of energy to you) + Taxes. This Agreement will continue to govern the service of such Accounts during such holdover term. Either party may terminate the holdover term at any time within its discretion at which time we will drop each Account as of the next possible meter read date to the then applicable tariff service, whether default service or otherwise.

Your Invoice. Your invoice will contain all charges applicable to your electricity usage, including Taxes (which are passed through to you). You will receive one invoice from the UDC for UDC charges and one invoice from us for all other charges ("Dual Billing") unless we agree otherwise, or your Account(s) eligibility changes. All amounts charged are due in full within twenty (20) days of the invoice date, and we reserve the right to adjust amounts previously invoiced based upon supplemental or additional data we may receive from your UDC. Your invoices will be based on actual data provided by the UDC, provided that if we do not receive actual data in a timely manner, we will make a good faith estimate using your historical usage data and other information. Once we receive actual data we will reconcile the estimated charges and adjust them as needed in subsequent invoices. If you fail to make payment by the due date, interest will accrue daily on outstanding amounts from the due date until the bill is paid in full at a rate of $1.50 \%$ per month, or the highest rate permitted by law, whichever is less. All invoices (including adjustments to those invoices) are conclusively presumed final and accurate unless such invoices are objected to by either you or us in writing, including adequate explanation and/or documentation, within 24 months after the date such invoice was rendered, provided however, we may rebill based on post-period audits or adjustments made by the ISO, UDC, or other governmental authority, commission or agency with jurisdiction in the state in which the Accounts are located.

Certain Warranties. You warrant and represent that for Account(s) located in the State of Illinois, your aggregate consumption and usage during any 12 month period is greater than 15,000 kilowatt-hours and that the electricity supplied under this Agreement is not for use at a residence.

Notices. All notices will be in writing and delivered by hand, certified mail, return receipt requested, or by first class mail, or by express carrier to our respective business addresses. Our business address is 1001 Louisiana St. Constellation Suite 2300, Houston, TX 77002, Attn: Contracts Administration. Either of us can change our address by notice to the other pursuant to this paragraph.

Customer Service. For questions about your invoice or our services, contact us at our Customer Service Department by calling toll-free 844-636-3749, or by e-mail at CustomerCare@Constellation.com.

Authorization. You authorize the UDC to provide us with your historical and future energy billing and usage data (which includes your electricity usage levels for distinct time periods as short as 30 minutes, to the extent that this information has been recorded and retained by the UDC). This authorization is for purposes of the development and provision of current and future products or services in connection with the services contemplated in this Agreement, and will remain in effect during the entire term of this Agreement, including any renewal, unless you rescind the authorization upon written notice to us or by calling us at 1-844-6-ENERGY. We reserve the right to cancel this Agreement in the event you rescind the authorization.

You will deliver any required cash deposit or other required security (or any increase therein) within three (3) business days of our request.
3. Default under this Agreement.

4. Remedies upon default; Early Termination Payment. If you are in default under this Agreement, in addition to any other remedies available to us, we may terminate this Agreement entirely, or solely with respect to those Accounts adversely affected by such default, and switch your Account(s) back to UDC service (consistent with applicable regulations and UDC practices); and/or you will be required to pay us an early termination payment to compensate us for all losses we sustain due to your default, including:

- all amounts you owe us for electricity provided to you;

5. Changes in law. We may pass through or allocate, as the case may be, to you any increase or decrease in our costs related to the electricity and related products and services sold to you that results from the implementation of new, or changes (including changes to formula rate calculations) to existing, Laws, or other requirements or changes in administration or interpretation of Laws or other requirements.

Examples of such events include: acts of God, fire, flood, hurricane, war, terrorism; declaration of emergency by a governmental entity, the ISO or the UDC; curtailment, disruption or interruption of electricity transmission, distribution or supply; regulatory, administrative, or legislative action, or action or restraint by court order or other governmental entity; actions taken by third parties not under your or our control, such as the ISO or a UDC. Such events shall not excuse failure to make payments due in a timely manner for electricity supplied to you prior to such event. Further, if such an event prevents or makes it impossible or impracticable for the claiming party to carry out any obligation under this Agreement due to the events beyond either of our reasonable control for more than 30 days, then whichever one of us whose performance was not prevented by such events shall have the right to terminate this Agreement without penalty upon 30 days' written notice to the other.
7. UDC or ISO obligations. We will have no liability or responsibility for matters within the control of the UDC or the ISO-controlled grid, which include maintenance of electric lines and systems, service interruptions, loss or termination of service, deterioration of electric services, or meter readings.

total liability related to this Agreement, whether arising under breach of contract, tort, strict liability or otherwise, will be limited to direct, actual damages. Direct, actual damages payable to us will reflect the early termination payment calculation in Section 4. Each party agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate damages it may incur. NO WARRANTY, DUTY, OR REMEDY, WHETHER EXPRESSED, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, ON OUR PART IS GIVEN OR INTENDED TO ARISE OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING ANY WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR USE.
9. DISPUTE RESOLUTION.

We are not acting as your consultant or advisor, and you will not rely on us in evaluating the advantages or disadvantages of any specific product or service, predictions about future energy prices, or any other matter. Your decision to enter into this Agreement and any other decisions or actions you may take is and will be based solely upon your own analysis (or that of your advisors) and not on information or statements from us.

Consistent with applicable regulatory requirements, we will hold in confidence all information obtained by us from you related to the provision of services under this Agreement and which concern your energy characteristics and use patterns, except that we may, consistent with applicable law and regulation, disclose such information to (a) our affiliates and such affiliates' employees, agents, advisors, and independent contractors, (b) third parties representing you in this purchase of electricity, and (c) other third parties, if the information (i) is presented in aggregate and (ii) cannot be reasonably expected to identify you. Except as otherwise required by law, you will agree to keep confidential the terms of our Agreement, including price.
12. Miscellaneous Provisions. If in any circumstance we do not provide notice of, or object to, any default on your part, such situation will not constitute a waiver of any future default of any kind. If any of this Agreement is held legally invalid, the remainder will not be affected and will be valid and enforced to the fullest extent permitted by law and equity, and there will be deemed substituted for the invalid provisions such provisions as will most nearly carry out our mutual intent as expressed in this Agreement. You may not assign or otherwise transfer any of your rights or obligations under this Agreement without our prior written consent. Any such attempted transfer will be void. We may assign our rights and obligations under this Agreement. This Agreement contains the entire agreement between both of us, supersedes any other agreements, discussions or understandings (whether written or oral) regarding the subject matter of this Agreement, and may not be contradicted by any prior or contemporaneous oral or written agreement.

Applicable provisions of this Agreement will continue in effect after termination or expiration of this Agreement to the extent necessary, including those for billing adjustments and payments, indemnification, limitations of liability, and dispute resolution. This Agreement is a "forward contract" and we are a "forward contract merchant" under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, as amended. Further, we are not providing advice regarding "commodity interests", including futures contracts and commodity options or any other matter, which would cause us to be a commodity trading advisor under the U.S. Commodity Exchange Act, as amended.
