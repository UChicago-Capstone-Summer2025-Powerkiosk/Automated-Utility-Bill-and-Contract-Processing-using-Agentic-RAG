This bill reflects BPU-approved changes in the Supply and Delivery portions of your electric bill, effective on and after April 1, 2024. The decrease in the Supply portion of your bill is due to changes in the Transmission Charge.

As a result of these changes, a typical residential customer who receives electric Supply from PSE\&G and uses 577 kilowatt-hours in an average month, will see no change in their bill. Tariff information may also be found by visiting pseg.com.

## Explaining gas charges

We measure the volume of gas you use in cubic feet (CCF) and then convert it to therms.
If you used a standard gas clothes dryer, it would take about 6 hours to equal 1 therm of energy.

## About the balancing charge

The balancing charge includes pipeline, storage and other costs associated with seasonal peaks in usage. It applies from October to May.

## Price to compare

If you want to consider getting your gas supply from another supplier, you can compare their price with ours. This month, your cost for gas supply is $\$ 169.04$ (or an average of 0.38750454 per therm). This price to compare varies from month to month, depending on your usage.

Your PoD ID is: PG000009401655766008 Your PoD ID is your Point of Delivery identification within PSE\&G's system. You will need this number if you are considering enrolling with another supplier.
