Transaction Procedures: The procedures herein stated are adopted by the Parties as a means by which Transactions are formed, and the Parties are identified and authenticate a Transaction. A Transaction formed and effectuated by such procedures shall be considered a 'writing' or 'in writing' and to have been 'signed,' and this Sales Confirmation and any Transaction Confirmation shall be considered to constitute an 'original' document evidencing a Transaction. The Parties agree not to contest or assert a defense to the validity or enforceability of any Transaction entered into in accordance with these procedures. Each Party represents to the other Party that each of its representatives has authority to enter into an oral Transaction in accordance herewith.

Material Change: Buyer shall notify Seller of any change in its operations or activities that could reasonably be expected to result in a material change in Buyer's Metered Usage during the Term within a commercially reasonable period of time prior to the implementation of such change. 'Material change' shall mean Buyer's Metered Usage changes by more than $25 \%$ as compared to Baseline Usage and lasting more than 2 billing cycles. 'Baseline Usage' shall mean historical usage as measured by the DSP for the most recent 12-month period prior to the Service Start Date. In the event that such 12-month period data is not available, the Baseline Usage shall be determined based upon best available usage information. If Seller determines that Buyer's Metered Usage (a), as established by the DSP has materially changed or (b) is likely to materially change, in either case, as compared to past practice or the historical data provided by the DSP for Buyer's Delivery Points, Seller may, in addition to other remedies provided for herein, add to the amount paid by Buyer, as specified in the 'Pricing' section above, the amount necessary to account for Seller's incremental costs resulting from or likely to result from, as applicable, the change to Metered Usage.

On-Site Generation Disclosure: The Buyer hereby represents and warrants to Seller that there is no existing on-site generation installed at any of Buyer's Delivery Point(s) set forth in this Sales Confirmation, except as listed in Table 1 below. For any anticipated Material Reduction in Metered Usage related to new (or increased) self-generation, Buyer shall provide written notice to Seller no less than ninety (90) days prior to the anticipated change. Material Reduction shall mean Buyer's Metered Usage reduces by more than $15 \%$ as compared to Baseline Usage. If Seller determines that Buyer's Metered Usage has materially changed as a result of new or increased self-generation, Seller may add to the amount paid by Buyer, as specified in the Pricing section above, the amount necessary to account for Seller's incremental costs resulting from or likely to result from the change in Metered Usage.

Table 1:

| Facility Name |  |  |  | Generation Type |  |  | Nameplate Capacity |  |  |  |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

Baseline Usage: 'Baseline Usage' shall mean the average twelve (12) months of usage identified in Table 2.
Table 2 (MWh):

| Jan | Feb | Mar | Apr | May | Jun | Jul | Aug | Sep | Oct | Nov | Dec |
| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |

Usage Beyond Expiration: In the event Buyer does not timely execute a new agreement prior to the Service End Date, whether by expiration or termination, then electricity supply services may continue hereunder following the Service End Date on a month to month basis until a new agreement is executed upon mutual agreement of the Parties (the 'Transition Period'). In lieu of the pricing described in this Agreement, Buyer shall pay Seller an amount during the Transition Period for full requirements service and a market adjusted price as determined by Seller in its sole and exclusive discretion for the relevant Delivery Point for the Account(s) plus $\$ 5.00$ per MWh (the 'Transition Price' or 'TP'). The amount owed by Buyer to Seller during the Transition Period shall be the product of the Transition Price and the Metered Usage adjusted to include Distribution and Transmission Losses.

Adding and Deleting Accounts: Buyer is permitted to add or delete ESAs provided that there is no Event of Default by Buyer, and any such ESA to be added is located within the DSP area currently served by Seller. In the event that ESAs are added and/or deleted, the Parties shall modify the Service Accounts list accordingly subject to a 5\% Metered Usage change allowance as compared to Baseline Usage provisions contained within the Sales Confirmation. The Parties hereby agree that a formal written Addendum to the Sales Confirmation shall be required if Service Accounts are simply being added/deleted without any additional changes to the respective Sales Confirmation.

Billing and Payment Terms: The Delivery Point(s) set forth shall be billed according to Dual bill methodology. Applicable to this Sales Confirmation, payment shall be due to Seller thirty (30) days after the billing date on the Buyer's invoice or the transmittal date on the email, whichever is later.

Customer Protection Rules: Buyer and Seller acknowledge and agree that, to the extent permitted by law, Buyer waives the application of consumer protection rules of the Board of Public Utilities, as now in effect or subsequently amended, that are intended to protect residential and very small commercial consumers. If there is any conflict between such consumer protection rules and this Agreement, the Parties acknowledge that this Agreement will control.

# MASTER RETAIL ELECTRICITY SALES AGREEMENT 

This MASTER RETAIL ELECTRICITY SALES AGREEMENT together with any "Sales Confirmation(s)" (and Transaction Confirmation(s) or Term Sheet(s), as applicable) (collectively, the "Agreement") is entered into and made by and between BP Energy Retail Company LLC ("Seller") and 153 Halsey Newark, LLC ("Buyer").This Agreement shall be effective as of November 21, 2023 (the "Effective Date"). Seller and Buyer may be individually referred to as "Party" or collectively as "Parties". Pending the execution of a Sales Confirmation, Seller shall have the right, but not the obligation, to provide retail electricity services to Buyer under this Agreement. The Parties hereby agree as follows:

1. Purchase and Sale: Seller shall sell and Buyer shall purchase and receive electricity to meet Buyer's full electricity requirements for Buyer's identified Electric Service Account(s) ("ESA(s)") specified in the Sales Confirmation. The terms and conditions of the purchase and sale are set forth in this Agreement and in the Sales Confirmation. The electricity will be delivered to Buyer's Transmission and Distribution Service Provider ("DSP") corresponding to the Buyer's ESA (the "Delivery Point") and title to and risk of loss related to electricity shall transfer from Seller to Buyer at the Delivery Point. Buyer acknowledges and understands that the delivery of electricity to Buyer's ESA will be accomplished exclusively by the DSP from the Delivery Point to the ESA.
2. Metering: All measurement of electricity delivered hereunder shall be and can only be provided by the DSP for each Delivery Point. "Metered Usage" shall be defined as the metered usage as provided by the DSP. "Total Usage" shall be defined as the metered usage plus the applicable transmission and distribution losses plus unaccounted for energy ("UFE") as published by the entity entrusted with transporting energy in the form of electrical power on a state or regional level using fixed infrastructure (e.g. ERCOT, PJM) (the "Transmission Operator") and DSP. Seller may use estimated Metered Usage if measurements of usage are not received timely from the DSP, in which case Seller will indicate that an estimate was used and will make appropriate adjustments upon receipt of definitive data verifying Metered Usage.
3. Switching: Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to effectuate a timely switch of Buyer's ESA to Seller. Seller cannot guarantee a switch of Buyer's ESA to Seller will occur by a specific date, and Seller shall not be liable for delays in this process caused by the DSP. The "Service Start Date" shall be the date upon which a particular ESA is switched to Seller. The Service Start Date is typically the scheduled read date that occurs during the month and year identified as the Start Date specified in the Sales Confirmation. The "Service End Date" is typically the scheduled read date that occurs during the month and year identified as the End Date specified in the Sales Confirmation. Each ESA may have a separate Service Start Date and Service End Date.
4. Billing \& Payment: Buyer will be invoiced the total amount due for electricity delivered to Buyer during each month in one of the following ways based on availability and eligibility of Buyer(s) ESA(s), which may change from time to time: (a) Dual Billing: Buyer will receive two invoices, one from Seller for amounts payable to Seller for its electricity ("Electricity Charges") and one from the DSP for the amounts payable by Buyer for services provided by the DSP ("DSP Charges"); or (b) DSP/Utility Consolidated: Buyer will receive one invoice from the DSP for both Electricity Charges and DSP Charges; or (c) Seller Consolidated: Buyer will receive one invoice from the Seller for both Electricity Charges and DSP Charges. All invoice types shall include all applicable DSP Charges on an invoice (as defined in the Sales Confirmation) and Taxes (as defined herein), and other charges allowed pursuant to this Agreement. Buyer and/or Buyer's representatives or agents will be given access to Seller's online invoicing system to retrieve invoices. Invoice notification and invoicing system access will be delivered to Buyer via email. Payment via ACH or wire transfer shall be due to Seller as set forth on the Sales Confirmation. All past due invoices will incur a late payment charge of one percent ( $1 \%$ ) of the invoice amount and the outstanding balance will accrue interest at the lesser of one percent ( $1 \%$ ) per month or the maximum amount allowable by law (the "Interest Rate"). Buyer shall be responsible for any and all collection costs incurred by Seller. If applicable, Buyer will continue to receive a separate invoice from the DSP for distribution and metering charges related to Buyer's receipt of electricity.
5. Disputed Amounts: Buyer will pay the undisputed amount of any invoice by the applicable due date. Buyer must provide written notice of any disputed amount to Seller not more than six (6) months from the date of Seller's invoice or such invoice will be deemed correct and accepted by Buyer. The Parties will use commercially reasonable efforts to expeditiously resolve any invoice disputed within the applicable time period. In the event of disputed DSP Charges and/or Metered Usage, Seller will use internal resources in an attempt to resolve the disputed charges on Buyer's behalf with the applicable DSP but in no event will Seller be obligated to take formal action or incur external costs to resolve any disputes with the DSP. In the event that Seller receives reimbursement from the DSP due to subsequent corrections, cancellations and/or rebills by the DSP, Seller will reimburse those to Buyer.
6. Blend and Extend - Rate Adjustment and Term Extension: At any time during the Term, Buyer may request that the Term be extended and the Contract Price (as defined in the Sales Confirmation) then in effect be changed. Upon request, Seller will submit an offer to Buyer reflecting a revised Contract Price and new Term.
7. Adding and Deleting Accounts: Buyer is permitted to add or delete ESA(s) provided that there is no Event of Default (as defined herein) by Buyer, and any such ESA to be added is located within the DSP area currently served by Seller. For specific details, please refer to the current Sales Confirmation(s).
8. Performance Assurance: If either Party determines in its reasonable discretion that the other Party's creditworthiness or ability to perform under this Agreement has become unsatisfactory due to a material adverse change in the financial conditions of the other Party then that Party (hereafter and for the purposes of this Paragraph (the "Requesting Party")) may require Performance Assurance. The Requesting Party shall provide the other Party (hereafter and for the purposes of this Paragraph (the "Receiving Party")) with written notice requesting such Performance Assurance in an amount determined by the Requesting Party in a commercially reasonable manner. Upon receipt of such notice the Receiving

Party shall have three (3) business days to provide such Performance Assurance to the Requesting Party. In the event that the Receiving Party fails to provide such Performance Assurance within three (3) business days of receipt of such notice, then an Event of Default shall be deemed to have occurred and the Requesting Party shall be entitled to exercise any remedies set forth in this Agreement. Performance Assurance shall mean cash, letter(s) of credit, corporate guarantees, or other security each in form and amount reasonably acceptable to the Requesting Party.
9. Financials: Upon request, if not available on EDGAR or the Buyer home page on the World Wide Web, the Buyer shall provide: (i) a copy of its most recently available annual report containing audited consolidated financial statements and/or (ii) a copy of its most recently available quarterly unaudited consolidated financial statements.
10. Term: This Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and shall continue in effect until (i) terminated earlier as provided in this Agreement or (ii) terminated by either Party upon 30 calendar days prior written notice to the other, except however, this Agreement will continue in full force and effect until the termination or expiration date specified in any active Sales Confirmation ("Expiration Date") (the "Term").
11. Assignment and Binding Effect: Neither Party may assign this Agreement without the express written consent of the other Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.
12. Regulatory Events: If there is a change in law, administrative regulation, rule, design or structure, order, judicial decision, statute, or a change in an interpretation, operation, administration or application of any of the foregoing (collectively, a "Regulatory Event") and such Regulatory Event causes Seller to directly or indirectly incur any capital, operating, commodity or other costs (including, but not limited to increased Taxes and redefinition of charges) relating to the provision of electricity contemplated herein above, or in addition to those existing prior to the date of the Regulatory Event, then Seller shall be permitted to pass through the economic effects of any such Regulatory Event to Buyer and Buyer shall pay or reimburse Seller for the dollar amounts attributable to such economic effects resulting from the Regulatory Event. Neither Party shall be obligated to perform under this Agreement if a Regulatory Event renders that Party's performance of its respective obligations illegal or impossible to perform, including, but not limited to the termination of retail sale of electricity.
13. Confidentiality: During the Term and for one (1) year afterwards, neither Party shall disclose the terms of this Agreement to a third party (other than the Party's affiliates, employees, lenders, counsel, consultants, accountants and other parties who have agreed to keep such terms confidential), except in order to comply with applicable law. Each Party shall notify the other Party of any proceeding of which it is aware which may result in disclosure. The Parties shall be entitled to all remedies available at law or in equity to enforce, or seek relief in connection with, this Paragraph.
14. Event of Default: An "Event of Default" shall mean with respect to a Party (a "Defaulting Party"), the occurrence of any of the following: (a) the failure to make when due, any payment required pursuant to this Agreement if such failure is not remedied within five (5) business days after written notice; (b) a representation or warranty made by a Party to this Agreement proves to have been false or misleading in any material respect when made or ceases to remain true during the Term; (c) the failure of a Party to perform any covenant set forth in this Agreement which is not excused by Force Majeure or cured within five (5) business days after written notice thereof; (d) the failure of a Party to provide Performance Assurance in accordance with Paragraph 8; (e) the failure of Buyer to utilize Seller as its sole supplier of electricity for its ESA(s) specified in the Sales Confirmation at any time during the Term (including but not limited to a switch of Buyer's electric service to another provider); or (f) a Party makes an assignment or any general arrangement for the benefit of creditors or otherwise becomes bankrupt or insolvent. A "Potential Event of Default" shall mean an event which, with notice or passage of time or both, would constitute or result in an Event of Default.
15. Remedies: (a) If an Event of Default or Potential Event of Default with respect to a Defaulting Party shall have occurred and be continuing, the other Party (the "Non-Defaulting Party") shall have the right (i) to designate a day from the notice date of termination, which may be retroactive in time to the date Buyer's ESA(s) were unenrolled from Seller's supply service, as an early termination date ("Early Termination Date") to accelerate all amounts owing between the Parties and to liquidate and terminate all of the transactions and sales of electricity existing under this Agreement between the Parties (including any fixed price, or other fixed price components underlying the establishment of the Contract Price) (the "Terminated Transactions"), (ii) to withhold any payments due to the Defaulting Party under this Agreement, and/or (iii) to suspend performance including, but not limited to, the suspension of any further deliveries of electricity. The Non-Defaulting Party shall calculate, in a commercially reasonable manner, a Settlement Amount (defined below) for the Terminated Transactions as of the Early Termination Date (or, if in the reasonable opinion of the Non-Defaulting Party certain of such Terminated Transactions are commercially impracticable to liquidate and terminate or may not be liquidated and terminated on the Early Termination Date, as soon thereafter as is reasonably practicable).
(b) For purposes of subparagraph (a) above, the "Settlement Amount" shall mean the present value of economic loss, plus any costs (including reasonable attorney's fees) incurred by either Buyer or Seller as the Non-Defaulting Party as a result of the early termination. For purposes hereof, the "present value" of any amount will be calculated in a commercially reasonable manner.
(c) If Buyer is the Defaulting Party, Seller's economic loss shall be calculated as follows: (i) the estimated undelivered volume of electricity that Buyer would have consumed from the Early Termination Date through the end of the applicable Term multiplied by the positive difference, if any, between the Contract Price or the Retail Adder, each as defined and set forth in the applicable Sales Confirmation and then current market price, plus (ii) in case of a variable product, the positive difference, if any, between the Contract Price and market price, multiplied by the remaining Contract Quantity (as defined and set forth in the applicable Sales Confirmation) for the Term.
(d) If Seller is the Defaulting Party, Buyer's economic loss shall be calculated as follows: (i) the estimated undelivered volume of electricity which Buyer would have consumed from the Early Termination Date through the end of the applicable Term multiplied by the negative difference between the Contract Price or the Retail Adder as set forth in the applicable Sales Confirmation and the price Buyer would have to pay to obtain the same service from a third party for the commercially reasonable price, plus (ii) in case of a variable product, the negative difference, if any, between the Contract Price and market price, multiplied by the remaining Contract Quantity for the Term.

(e) The Non-Defaulting Party shall aggregate all Settlement Amounts into a single amount by: netting out (i) at the option of the Non-Defaulting Party, any cash or other form of security then available to the Non-Defaulting Party pursuant to Paragraph 8, plus any or all other amounts due to the Defaulting Party under this Agreement, against (ii) all Settlement Amounts that are due to the Non-Defaulting Party, plus any or all other amounts due to the Non-Defaulting Party under this Agreement, so that all such amounts shall be netted out to a single liquidated amount (the "Termination Payment") payable by the Defaulting Party to the Non-Defaulting Party.
(f) As soon as practicable after the Non-Defaulting Party calculates the Termination Payment, notice shall be given by the Non-Defaulting Party to the Defaulting Party of the amount of the Termination Payment. The notice shall include a written statement explaining in reasonable detail the calculation of such amount. The Termination Payment shall be made by the Defaulting Party within five (5) business days after such notice is effective.
(g) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if (i) an Event of Default, or (ii) a Potential Event of Default (defined below) shall have occurred and be continuing, the Non-Defaulting Party, upon written notice to the Defaulting Party, shall have the right (1) to suspend performance under this Agreement; provided, however in no event shall any such suspension continue longer than ten (10) business days, unless an Early Termination Date shall have been declared and notice thereof has been given pursuant to this Paragraph, and (2) to the extent that an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, to exercise any remedy available at law or in equity.
16. Entirety of Agreement: It is the intention of the Parties that this Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the Parties, contains all terms, conditions, and protections in any way related to, or arising out of, the subject matter hereunder and supersedes all prior agreements, written or oral, or representations of any brokers or sales representatives.
17. Force Majeure: (a) Except for obligations for the payment of money, and in accordance with subparagraph (b) below, if either Party is rendered unable, wholly or in part, to perform its physical obligations under this Agreement (including but not limited to the delivery or receipt of electricity hereunder) due to Force Majeure, the physical obligations of each Party will be suspended for the duration of any inability to perform. A Party claiming Force Majeure (the "Claiming Party") will notify the other Party in writing as soon as possible following such occurrence, describing the nature, and estimated duration of such inability to perform. The cause of such inability to perform will be remedied with all reasonable dispatch. "Force Majeure" means any event or occurrence (including, but not limited to "Acts of God") that is beyond the control of a Party and that: (i) was not anticipated as of the date of this Agreement; (ii) was not the result of the negligence of the Claiming Party; and (iii) which, by the exercise of due diligence, the Claiming Party was unable to avoid or cause to be avoided. A claim of Force Majeure may not be based on: (i) Buyer's inability to economically use electricity purchased under this Agreement; (ii) Buyer's election to close, sell, abandon or materially curtail or discontinue operation of Buyer's facilities due to any economic circumstance; (iii) a Party's inability to acquire electricity at a particular price; or (iv) a Party's ability to sell electricity at a price above the Contract Price.
(b) Where Buyer is the Claiming Party, Buyer will provide notice to Seller of any event of Force Majeure immediately upon Buyer becoming aware of the applicable event of Force Majeure. Such notice shall be initially provided to Seller by telephone to the following number: 281-6531651; provided that for any such claim of Force Majeure to be effective, Buyer will also promptly provide written notice of the event of Force Majeure to Seller in accordance with subparagraph (a) above.
18. Forward Contract: The Parties acknowledge and agree that this Agreement and the transaction(s) contemplated under this Agreement constitute a "forward contract" within the meaning of the United States Bankruptcy Code, and the Parties further acknowledge and agree that each Party is a "forward contract merchant" within the meaning of the United States Bankruptcy Code.
19. Indemnification: SELLER WILL INDEMNIFY, DEFEND AND HOLD HARMLESS BUYER, ITS OFFICERS, AGENTS, AND EMPLOYEES FROM ANY CLAIMS, DAMAGES AND ACTIONS OF ANY KIND ARISING FROM PERSONAL INJURY (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, DEATH), TANGIBLE PROPERTY DAMAGE OR ANY OTHER DAMAGES ARISING FROM OR OUT OF ANY EVENT, CIRCUMSTANCE, ACT OR INCIDENT OCCURRING PRIOR TO THE DELIVERY POINT WITH RESPECT TO THE ELECTRICITY PROVIDED PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT. BUYER WILL INDEMNIFY, DEFEND AND HOLD HARMLESS SELLER, ITS OFFICERS, AGENTS, AND EMPLOYEES FROM ANY CLAIMS, DAMAGES AND ACTIONS OF ANY KIND ARISING FROM PERSONAL INJURY (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, DEATH), TANGIBLE PROPERTY DAMAGE OR ANY OTHER DAMAGES ARISING FROM OR OUT OF ANY EVENT, CIRCUMSTANCE, ACT OR INCIDENT OCCURRING AT AND FROM THE DELIVERY POINT WITH RESPECT TO THE ELECTRICITY PROVIDED PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT.

THE PARTIES INTEND THAT THE LIMITATIONS HEREIN IMPOSED ON REMEDIES AND THE MEASURE OF DAMAGES BE WITHOUT REGARD TO THE CAUSES RELATED THERETO INCLUDING THE NEGLIGENCE OF ANY PARTY, WHETHER SUCH NEGLIGENCE BE SOLE, JOINT OR CONCURRENT, OR ACTIVE OR PASSIVE. TO THE EXTENT ANY DAMAGES REQUIRED TO BE PAID HEREUNDER ARE CHARACTERIZED OR DEEMED TO BE LIQUIDATED DAMAGES, THE PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE DAMAGES ARE DIFFICULT OR IMPOSSIBLE TO DETERMINE, OBTAINING AN ADEQUATE REMEDY IS INCONVENIENT AND THE LIQUIDATED DAMAGES CONSTITUTE A REASONABLE APPROXIMATION OF THE HARM OR LOSS. EXCEPT FOR THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES SET FORTH HEREIN, SELLER EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS AND MAKES NO WARRANTIES, WHETHER WRITTEN OR ORAL, WITH RESPECT TO THE ELECTRICITY SUPPLIED UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE LIMITATIONS SET FORTH IN THIS PARAGRAPH SHALL SURVIVE THE EXPIRATION OR EARLY TERMINATION OF THIS AGREEMENT.

21. Modification of Agreement: Any alteration, deletion or addition to the Agreement shall be effective only if made in a written amendment executed by both Parties.

Electronic Record and Signature Disclosure

# ELECTRONIC RECORD AND SIGNATURE DISCLOSURE 

From time to time, URA, Inc. (we, us or Company) may be required by law to provide to you certain written notices or disclosures. Described below are the terms and conditions for providing to you such notices and disclosures electronically through the DocuSign, Inc. (DocuSign) electronic signing system. Please read the information below carefully and thoroughly, and if you can access this information electronically to your satisfaction and agree to these terms and conditions, please confirm your agreement by clicking the 'I agree' button at the bottom of this document.

## Getting paper copies

At any time, you may request from us a paper copy of any record provided or made available electronically to you by us. You will have the ability to download and print documents we send to you through the DocuSign system during and immediately after signing session and, if you elect to create a DocuSign signer account, you may access them for a limited period of time (usually 30 days) after such documents are first sent to you. After such time, if you wish for us to send you paper copies of any such documents from our office to you, you will be charged a $\$ 0.00$ per-page fee. You may request delivery of such paper copies from us by following the procedure described below.

## Withdrawing your consent

If you decide to receive notices and disclosures from us electronically, you may at any time change your mind and tell us that thereafter you want to receive required notices and disclosures only in paper format. How you must inform us of your decision to receive future notices and disclosure in paper format and withdraw your consent to receive notices and disclosures electronically is described below.

## Consequences of changing your mind

If you elect to receive required notices and disclosures only in paper format, it will slow the speed at which we can complete certain steps in transactions with you and delivering services to you because we will need first to send the required notices or disclosures to you in paper format, and then wait until we receive back from you your acknowledgment of your receipt of such paper notices or disclosures. To indicate to us that you are changing your mind, you must withdraw your consent using the DocuSign 'Withdraw Consent' form on the signing page of a DocuSign envelope instead of signing it. This will indicate to us that you have withdrawn your consent to receive required notices and disclosures electronically from us and you will no longer be able to use the DocuSign system to receive required notices and consents electronically from us or to sign electronically documents from us.

## All notices and disclosures will be sent to you electronically

Unless you tell us otherwise in accordance with the procedures described herein, we will provide electronically to you through the DocuSign system all required notices, disclosures, authorizations, acknowledgements, and other documents that are required to be provided or made available to you during the course of our relationship with you. To reduce the chance of you inadvertently not receiving any notice or disclosure, we prefer to provide all of the required notices and disclosures to you by the same method and to the same address that you have given us. Thus, you can receive all the disclosures and notices electronically or in paper format through the paper mail delivery system. If you do not agree with this process, please let us know as described below. Please also see the paragraph immediately above that describes the consequences of your electing not to receive delivery of the notices and disclosures
