National Grid reserves the right to upwardly adjust a previously issued bill or back bill.
Basic Service: A charge to cover costs for meter reading, billing, equipment and maintenance. This charge is the same regardless of how much energy is used during the billing period.
Tariff Surcharge: New York State and many local municipalities impose taxes on National Grid's revenue. These operating costs are recovered through a tariff surcharge applied to all rates and charges and may vary among taxing municipalities within the National Grid system area.
Sales Tax: In some areas National Grid is required to collect state and local sales taxes. Some school districts also impose taxes.

## Billing Credits

Paperless Billing Credit: A credit provided to Customers who elect to receive their bills electronically through the Company's Online Bill-Pay Program.
Outage Credit : A Credit issued by the company in the event of a prolonged electric service outage.

## Energy Measurement Terms

kWh: The unit of electricity usage measured by your meter. One kilowatt-hour(kWh) is 1000 watts-hours, and will light a 100-watt bulb for 10 hours. The number of kWh is is used to determine the electricity charges on your bill.
Meter Multiplier: Due to their design, some meters record a fraction of the total usage. The multiplier is used to convert the recorded meter reading on these types of meters to total actual consumption.

## Electric Service

Delivery: National Grid's charge for bringing electricity from your supplier to your premise, regardless of supplier. Included, when applicable, are the following surcharges: Earnings Adjustment Mechanism, Dynamic Load Management, Non-Wires Alternative, Clean Energy Standard Delivery, Value of Delivery Energy Resources and Reliability Services Surcharge.

Merchant Function Charge: A charge for the Company's cost to procure electricity supply. The Company will not bill you this charge if you choose an alternate supplier.
Capacity Tag: Your adjusted electricity demand at the hour of the New York Control Area peak load in the most recent 12 month period ending May 1.
SBC: These charges reflect costs associated with mandated public policy programs, such as the Clean Energy Fund.
Clean Energy Delivery :Charges associated with Clean Energy Standard program costs.
Revenue Decoupling Mechanism ("RDM") Reconciles actual billed delivery service revenues to annual target revenues. Delivery service revenues above target are refunded to customers. Target revenues above actual delivery service revenues are collected from customers.
Transmission Revenue Adjustment: Reconciles wholesale transmission service revenue to the forecasted transmission service revenue embedded in electric delivery rates. Transmission service revenues above those forecasted are credited to customers. Forecast revenues above actual revenues are collected from customers.
SBC Exemption: A credit provided to Customers who are not subject to the SBC.
Electricity Supply: The price of electricity supply used during the billing period. If you choose an alternate supplier, the price will be what you agree upon with that supplier.
Electricity Supply Reconciliation Mechanism (ESRM): Reconciles National Grid's electricity supply service revenues to the cost of Company purchased electricity, including Clean Energy Standard costs. Costs above revenues are recovered from customers. Revenues above costs are credited to customers.

## Estimating Your Usage

When we are unable to obtain a reading, we estimate your usage based on your past usage, taking current weather conditions into account. Because our meters keep a continuous record of usage, any difference between estimated and actual usage is reconciled with the next meter reading. To avoid estimated readings, you can take your own reading on or just before the scheduled date shown on your bill and call it in at 1-888-932-0301.

# Chapter 10 

## Rights and Responsibilities of Non-Residential Customers

As a National Grid customer receiving non-residential service in New York State, you have certain rights and responsibilities. This pamphlet summarizes your rights, as well as your responsibilities and obligations. If anything in this pamphlet is not clear, you may call our Commercial and Industrial Business Team at 1-800-864-6729. Monday-Friday, 8 a.m.-5 p.m. Our tariff is available for review at the New York State Public Service Commission (PSC) headquarters in Albany or on our website at nationalgridus.com. These rights and responsibilities are provided for in Part 13, Rules of Subchapter B, Chapter 1. Title 16 of the New York Code of Rules and Regulations.

## Applications for Non-Residential Service

You may apply for service by telephone. However, you may be required to complete a written application for service.
Following the receipt of a completed application, we will either provide or deny service within 10 days, unless prevented by circumstances beyond our control. If service is denied, we will provide you with a written statement containing our reasons for denial, what you must do to qualify for service and notice of your right to appeal to the PSC. If you qualify for service, you may be required to pay any past due amounts for which you are responsible and comply with all other customer responsibilities as required by our tariff before service is turned on. Additionally, if another party controls access to our meters, you will be required to provide us with the name and contact information of that party.

## Eligibility for Residential Rates

Certain religious organizations, farms, community residences as defined in the Mental Hygiene Law, and posts or halls owned or leased by a not-for-profit corporation that is a veterans' organization, may be eligible for billing at residential rates. Residential rates may be more beneficial depending on factors including the type (gas or electric), amount, and pattern of usage. In order to qualify, National Grid requires evidence of eligibility. For more information about eligibility requirements, call 1-800-864-6729. Monday-Friday, 8 a.m. - 5 p.m.

## Deposit Policy

When you apply for service, National Grid may require that you pay a security deposit prior to establishing service in your name. Deposits may also be required from existing customers who have either become delinquent or before reliable evidence exist(s) are likely to default on payment of billed service charges. Deposits also may be obtained from customers who have fixed for reorganization or bankruptcy and from some customers who are back billed for service provided through tampered equipment.
You can pay a security deposit by cash, check or by an alternative method such as a surely bond or letter of credit. Please note that National Grid pays interest only on security deposits that are paid in full by cash or check. Such deposits are held at a rate of interest set by the PSC. Interest is either paid to you at the time your deposit is returned or annually applied to your account as a credit for as long as we continue to hold the deposit. Deposits will be returned after three years if you have paid all of your service bills on time and there is no evidence that adverse financial conditions exist.
Security deposit amounts will ordinarily be twice the cost of your average monthly usage. In the case of customers whose usage varies widely, however, the amount can be twice the cost of your average monthly usage during the peak usage season.

## Meter Reading and Billing Policy

We are responsible for supplying gas and/or electric service to our customers in a reliable manner and accurately billing customers for the service they use.
You, as our customer, are responsible for arranging access to our meters and have an obligation to pay your utility bills on time. Here are some important highlights of our billing policies and procedures:

## When To Pay - National Grid bills are due and payable when

received. A payment is considered (overdue 20 days after the bill is mailed to you. You will see a date on your service bill that tells you what date you must pay the bill by to avoid late charges.
Where To Pay - Payments can be made by mail, at payment agencies located throughout our service area, through Online Bill-Pay, or by automatic withdrawal from your bank account (Direct Debit). To by mail, use the return envelope included with your service bill. For more information, visit nationalgridus.com or call 1-800-864-6729.

## Bill Contents - All of our service bills contain the following information:

1. Our Company's name and location of our main office.
2. The service classification (rate) on which we are billing you.
3. Your name, account number and service address.
4. The start and end dates of the billing period.
5. The quantity of service billed.
6. The amount of individual charges and total charges billed.
7. A date by which you must pay to avoid late payment charges.
8. A telephone number to call if you have a question about your bill.

## Budget Plan - If you want to spread your energy charges as evenly

as possible over a 12-month period, National Grid offers the Budget Plan. This payment plan does not reduce your overall energy expenses, but it may help you manage your budget. This plan is available to all non-residential customers except:
1. Customers who have less than 12 months of billing history at the premises.
2. Seasonal, short-term or temporary customers.
3. Customers who have arrears.
4. Interruptible, temperature-controlled or dual-fuel customers.
5. Customers who, for any reason, ceased being billed on a previous levelized payment plan before the end of the plan year, in the past 24 months.
6. Customers whose pattern of consumption is not sufficiently predictable to be estimated on an annual basis with any reasonable degree of certainty.
This voluntary plan is designed to reduce fluctuations in payments caused by seasonal patterns of consumption. If you would like more information or wish to determine whether you are eligible, call 1-800664-6729. Monday-Friday, 8 a.m.-5 p.m.

## Meter Reading/Access to Meters - Normal reading hours

are from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. on business days. If we are unable to get to the meter, we will either estimate your bill or, in some cases, make additional attempts to actually read the meter.
If estimates continue, we are required by law to provide you with notices stating that we are unable to get to the meters and that you have an obligation to arrange access or be subject to additional notices and penalties in the form of charges that can be added to your service bill. Once you have exceeded the maximum number of allowable consecutive estimates, a $\$ 100$ continuing charge can be added each time a regularly scheduled reading fails to produce an actual reading. If there is a problem with access to your meter on a regular basis, please contact us to arrange a special appointment or report your reading at 1-888-932-0001 or nationalgridus.com.
Estimated Bills - If we are unable to read your meter, you may receive an estimated bill. The method we use to estimate service bills is approved by the PSC and each estimated bill clearly states that service charges billed are based on an estimate. Many estimated bills will also contain the Access to Meter notices mentioned previously. The company has the right to revise estimated bills, which may result in additional charges to you. Subsequent revision of estimated bills may potentially be avoided by arranging for appropriate access to the meter.

## Back billing - If we send you a bill for charges not previously billed,

the bill will contain an explanation of our reasons for the back billing. Additionally, customers receiving back bills for a period of time exceeding one month have the right to request a billing statement showing how the charges were calculated and will be offered the opportunity to pay over a period of time by entering into a Deferred Payment Agreement.

## Deferred Payment Agreements

Non-residential customers experiencing financial difficulty may qualify for arrangements to pay past due bills over a specified period of time. If you are eligible for this type of agreement, we have the right to a down payment. By law, if we make a field visit to shut off service, this down payment may be up to 50 percent of your outstanding balance or four times your average monthly usage, whichever is greater. If you contact us prior to a scheduled field visit, the down payment need not exceed 30 percent of the outstanding balance or twice your average monthly usage, whichever is greater. If you are eligible, and enter into a Deferred Payment Agreement with us, you will be required to pay the following:
1. The down payment required.
2. All future current bills on time.
3. The monthly installment amounts on time.

You also may be required to pay:
1. Late payment charges on the remaining past due balance.
2. A security deposit that can be paid in up to three installments, with 50 percent down and two monthly payments of the balance. The best way to determine if you are eligible for this type of arrangement is to contact us by phone.

If you are back billed for an amount in excess of $\$ 100$, you may request to pay in installments by entering into a Deferred Payment Agreement. Agreements on back billed amounts require payment of current bills on time and a monthly installment amount on the back bill.

Inspection and Examination of Meters and Other Utility Apparatus
Right to Inspect - National Grid personnel, or agents acting on our behalf, have the right to inspect meters and other equipment at all reasonable times, provided they can produce a photo identification badge that confirms they are authorized to do so. A customer who prevents or hinders such an inspection may be billed a $\$ 100$ penalty for each such offense.
Duty to Inspect - We have a duty to perform a field inspection of our equipment when we have received a reasonable request from a customer, a report of possible metering problems or a directive from the PSC. It is our obligation to provide such an inspection within 60 days of receipt of the request, unless circumstances beyond our control prevent completion of the inspection.
Inactive Gas Meters - All premises with open gas meters must have an active customer on the gas account. Open meters at premises with no responsible customer will either be locked or removed, or the service line supplying gas to the premises will be cut off. Customers terminating service should coordinate an appointment to lock the meter.

## Late Payment and Other Charges

We may impose a continuing late payment charge of 1.5 percent permonth on the unpaid balance of past service bills, any unpaid latepayment charges applied to previous bills, amounts previously unbilled where service was provided through tampered equipment or the balance due under a Deferred Payment Agreement.
We may also impose a reasonable charge for other lawful purposes, such as handling a dishonored check, reestablishment of service, customer costs or customer failure to provide access to meters or other Company equipment.

If you fail to pay past due bills, we may turn off your service after we have given the required notice. Some nonresidential customers, however, qualify for Home Energy Fair Practices Act (HEFPA) special protections. To find out if you qualify for these protections, please contact us.
Final Termination Notice - A Final Termination Notice may be sent if your bill is not paid and 23 days have elapsed since the date it was sent. If a Final Termination Notice is personally served on you, service may be shut off in five days; if the Final Termination Notice is mailed, service may be shut off in eight days from the mailing date. The notice will tell you the amount you may be shut off for, the earliest date service may be shut off, how you can contact us to discuss payment of the bill and what procedures (both National Grid and PSC) are available should you have a complaint or feel there may be a problem with your bill.
Termination of Service - We are allowed to shut off service for nonpayment between 8 a.m. and 6 p.m. Monday through Friday. We cannot shut off services in Saturday or Sunday, a public holiday as defined in the General Construction Law of the State or on any day that either our offense or the PSC offices are closed. At the time service is to be shut off, you have the right to pay the Company field representative to avoid disconnection. If you have paid us with a dishonored check in the last 24 months, however, we have the right to accept only a certified check, money order or cash as payment. It service is to be shut off after 3 p.m. on a day preceding a day when termination of service is prohibited, our field representative will contact you and be prepared to accept payments (including personal checks) to avoid termination of service.
Interruption of Service Without Advance Notice - We can turn off service without prior notice in the following circumstances:

1. When an emergency threatens the safety of persons, areas or our equipment.
2. When there is a need to repair, change or improve our equipment.
3. When there is a governmental order directing us to do so.

National Grid will, however, attempt to notify our customers (when reasonably feasible) prior to such interruptions.
Restoration of Service - If your service is shut off for nonpayment of bills, failure to provide access to our meters or a violation of our tariff, we will restore service within 24 hours after you have paid the bill, entered into a Deferred Payment Agreement, made satisfactory arrangements to grant us access or corrected the conditions that constitute the tariff violation. If we are unable to restore service due to circumstances beyond our control, we will restore service within 24 hours after such circumstances cease to exist.

## Demand Charges

Applied to nonresidential customers' service bills, demand charges help National Grid provide and maintain its electric service equipment and meet peak consumption periods.
Demand usage levels are used to determine the appropriate service classification under which a nonresidential customer will be billed. A change in recorded demand may cause a customer to be moved to a different service classification (SC) with different rates and charges, and may require that National Grid install a demand meter. If installation of a
demand meter is required, you my be required to make modifications to customer-owner electric equipment and service connections.
Whenever a nonresidential customer served under SC-2 has recorded energy consumption greater than 2,000 kWh per month for four consecutive months, or whenever the connected load of a customer indicates that the energy consumption will exceed 2,000 kWh per month, National Grid will install a demand meter. Once demand billing begins under SC-2, it does not end until after a customer's monthly energy consumption has been less than 2,000 kWh per month for 12 consecutive months. This requirement cannot be avoided by terminating service.
If a customer's monthly measured demand has equaled or exceeded 100 kW in each of the previous 12 months, or when in the Company's opinion the applican't's demand will equal or exceed 100 kW in 12 consecutive months, the customer will be moved to SC-3. A customer will remain on SC-3 until the monthly measured demand has been less than 100 kW for 12 consecutive months following the initial term of service.
Information relating to the applicability of service classifications and demand billing can be found in National Grid's electric tariff.
Important Information for Landlords
By law, tenants are required to pay only for the electricity or natural gas they use. Sometimes a tenant's electric or natural gas meter also registers electricity or natural gas used outside the tenant's dwelling. This is called a "shared meter" condition. A tenant that is billed for a shared condition must be reimbursed by law and/or, under certain conditions, with our approval, a tenant may enter into a mutually acceptable agreement with their landlord to address the situation. To determine if a shared meter condition might exist, we will need access to the apartment, the meters and any common areas of the building. National Grid is required by law to provide written notification of a pending investigation and the resulting determination to all parties involved. Failure by the landlord to cooperate with our request to investigate may still result in our determination of a "shared meter" condition. If the landlord fails to take any action within 120 days of a "shared meter" determination, the law requires that National Grid establish an account in the landlord's name for all future service measured on the shared meter until they meet compliance requirements. Under certain circumstances, the landlord may be billed for other charges, where applicable, regardless if the situation is corrected or not.
More information about shared metering can be obtained at nationalgridus.com or by calling 1-800-642-4272.

## Complaint Handling Procedures

Contact National Grid as soon as possible if you have any complaints, questions or problems about your service. You are entitled to a prompt answer and National Grid representatives are available to help you by phone 24 hours a day. Call our Customer Service Contact Center at 1-800-642-4272. You may also call our Commercial and Industrial Business Team at 1-800-664-6729, Monday-Friday, 8 a.m.-5 p.m. Emergency service is available 24 hours a day, every day. In a life-threatening gas emergency, please call 1-800-892-3345 or call 911. For electric emergencies, please call 1-800-867-5222.
Our customer service representatives will do their best to handle your inquiry promptly and considerately. If, however, you are not satisfied by our representative's response or determination, please request that your inquiry or complaint be reviewed by a supervisor. If we are unable to help, you may contact the New York State Public Service Commission online at dps.rw.gov/complaints, by calling 1-800-342-3377 (tail free), 8:30 a.m. - 4 p.m. Monday-Friday, or by mail: New York State Public Service Commission, Empire State Plaza, Albany, NY 12223. PSC consumer representatives will investigate your complaint and issue a determination. The PSC also has a special emergency hotline for residential customers and nonresidential customers with service provided to residential dwelling units. The hotline number is 1-800-342-3355.
While your complaint is being considered by the PSC, we cannot shut off your service for failure to pay an amount in dispute or for any other reason that is the subject of the complaint. We do have the right, however, to terminate service for nonpayment of billed amounts not in dispute or for other valid reasons not at issue in the complaint.
