- THE SUPPORT TO STOP A SCAM: The ability to send money through mobile-pay apps like QuickPay, Zelle and Venmo makes it easier to fall for scam attempts. These apps have higher limits and are often linked to your personal bank account or credit card. Scammers claim they didn't see the transaction and ask it to be sent again - scamming you twice. Take steps to protect yourself from energy fraud. We can help with tips and hints to recognize potential scams and legitimate ComEd employees. Learn more: ComEd.Com/ScamAlert
- MYLAR BALLOONS \& POWER LINES DON'T MIX! Every year, thousands of residents across northern Illinois are affected by power outages caused by foil balloons. If a foil or Mylar balloon touches a power line, it can cause power surges or service interruptions. Keep balloons tied securely while outside! If you see a balloon, or any object, caught in a power line, do not attempt to retrieve it. Call ComEd at 1-800-EDISON-1.
