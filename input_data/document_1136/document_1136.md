## Gas Safety

In case of an emergency, such as odor of gas, carbon monoxide or fire:

1. Leave the building or area immediately.
2. Leave windows and doors in their positions and avoid doing anything that could cause a spark.
3. From a safe place, away from the building or area, call $\mathbf{9 1 1}$ and NIPSCO at 1-800-6343324.

Always Call 8-1-1 Before You Dig
If you're planning a home or landscaping project, call Indiana 811 at least two business days before digging. A representative will mark the approximate location of underground utility lines for free.
