# PURCHASE PRICE 

## Nymex Plus : \$0.712/MMBTU

## SPECIAL PROVISIONS

NYMEX Plus with Trigger: For each month of the Delivery Period, the Purchase Price for the Contract Quantity, subject to the Gas Settlement Adjustment provision, will equal a fixed Basis charge of \$0.712/MMBTU, plus the Commodity charge for that month. Unless the Commodity charge has been set by agreement of the Parties in accordance with the instructions detailed below, the Commodity charge shall be the per Dth price equal to the settlement price on the expiration date for that month's New York Mercantile Exchange Henry Hub natural gas futures contract ("NYMEX Contract").

Buyer may fix the Commodity charge for blocks of Commodity through a Buyer-initiated trigger process ("Trigger Order"). Trigger Orders may be initiated for a specific individual month ("Monthly Order") or for a specific set of contiguous months within the duration of the Delivery Period ("Strip Order"). Trigger Orders are filled on a best efforts basis during operating hours. The Commodity charge may be fixed by agreement of the Parties at any time prior to 1:00 PM on the expiration date of the applicable month's NYMEX Contract.

Buyer acknowledges that the Commodity charge may be set (fixed) for a period up to, but in no event beyond the "Max Commodity Date". The Max Commodity Date is defined as the latest date up to which the Parties may fix the Commodity charge, and is posted on your online account portal. Seller reserves the right to amend these date restrictions at its sole discretion.

Buyer's "Responsible Trigger Contact(s)" have been identified as JACK DEVEDJIAN [jdevedjian@habitat.com]. Seller will generate a confirmation to be sent to Buyer's Responsible Trigger Contact each time the Commodity charge is fixed ("Trigger Confirmation"). Each such Trigger Confirmation will be made a part of, and is not a replacement for, this Transaction Confirmation. All orders are binding upon being filled. Any notices regarding Trigger Confirmations must be sent to trigger@directenergy.com. Changes to the Responsible Trigger Contact must be communicated in writing through your Direct Energy Business Development Manager.
