This information may be used by SEUS to determine whether it will commence and/or continue to provide energy supply service to Customer and will not be disclosed to a third party unless required by law, required by court order, or with Customer's separate written consent. Customer's execution of this Agreement shall constitute authorization for the release of this information to SEUS. SEUS reserves the right to refuse to provide service to Customer under this Agreement and cancel this Agreement if it is unable to obtain the necessary Customer Information or it obtains Customer Information that it considers unsatisfactory. Customer's authorization for the Customer Information will remain in effect during any initial or renewal term of this

5. Term, Renewal, Charges and Fees, and Termination.
a. All Products Except Variable. This Agreement will begin upon the date the parties executed this Agreement (the "Execution Date"). It will continue for the period set forth in the Customer Disclosure Statement (the "Term") from the first meter read date after the EDC processes the Customer's enrollment with SEUS (the "Start Date"). SEUS shall not be held responsible for any delays in the Start Date caused by the actions or inactions of the EDC in processing the Customer's enrollment with SEUS.After the end of the Term, this Agreement will automatically continue on a month-tomonth basis at a variable rate methodology unless and until this Agreement is terminated by either party. For Residential and Small Commercial Customers only: As detailed in the Customer Disclosure Statement, not less than 45 days and no more than 90 days prior to the expiration of the Term, SEUS will notify Customer in writing of the pending contract expiration and switch upon automatic renewal to the variable rate methodology at which SEUS will continue to serve Customer. If SEUS does not receive notice from Customer, this Agreement will automatically renew and continue in full force and effect until canceled by Customer. SEUS can renew this Agreement without Customer's affirmative consent, including when there is a change in the rate or other terms and conditions.
i. Variable Rate Methodology: After the Term, the rate for electricity will be a variable rate that may be higher or lower each month and will be set in SEUS's

sole discretion. SEUS considers the following factors when setting variable rates:

- publicly available competitor pricing;
- strategic business objectives;
- customer retention or attrition;
- market volatility or uncertainty;
- anticipated customer usage;
- the cost of procuring power including wholesale prices, ancillary service costs, capacity auctions, utility fees, transmission and distribution losses, and storage costs;
- weather, supply congestion, and infrastructure issues;
- legal or regulatory issues; and
- profit margin.

SEUS may amortize sudden cost increases over multiple billing cycles so that its customers do not bear the burden of such increases in a single month. The variable rate may not correlate with changes in wholesale market prices or your EDC's rates. In addition, the variable rate may be higher than your EDC rate or other suppliers' rates. For Residential and Small Business customers only: Your rate for the first month under a variable rate methodology will be set forth in the second notice sent by SEUS as set forth in the Customer Disclosure Statement. You may obtain the average monthly rates for the previous twenty four (24) months for SEUS's customers in your EDC's service territory who received service on a variable rate ("Historical Rates") by contacting SEUS. Please note that Historical Rates are not indicative of current or future rates.
b. Variable Service. This Agreement will begin on the date the parties executed this Agreement (the "Execution Date") and will continue unless and until this Agreement is terminated by either party. SEUS will begin supplying electricity to Customer on the first meter read date after the EDC processes the Customer's enrollment with SEUS (the "Start Date"). SEUS shall not be held responsible for any delays in the Start Date caused by the actions or inactions of the EDC in processing the Customer's enrollment with SEUS.
c. Early Termination Fees. ETF shall equal the projected amount of electricity to be consumed by customer for the remainder of the Term multiplied by the difference between the contract price in effect for the remainder of the Term and the price at which SmartestEnergy US LLC can sell such electricity following the termination, or $\$ 500$ per non-residential account, whichever is greater. There are no early termination fees for Variable Service customers. For all other products, the early termination fee, if applicable, shall be the projected amount of electricity to be consumed by Customer for the remainder of the Term, multiplied by the difference between the contract price in effect for the remainder of the Term and the price at which SEUS can sell such electricity following the termination, or $\$ 500$ per
account, whichever is greater. For all residential customers, however, the early termination fee will be no greater than $\$ 100.00$ if there is less than 12 months left of the Term and $\$ 200.00$ if there is 12 months or more left of the Term. SEUS may terminate this agreement early for Customer fails to, i.) pay invoices timely ii.) provide performance assurance when requested, as provided in Sections 7 and 22, iii.) provide the notifications of behind the meter generation, net metering transactions or a state power allocation as required in Section 9, or iv.) provide credit support (if applicable) when due as specified in Attachment B or Section 23. If either Party terminates this Agreement early, then Customer shall owe an Early Termination Fee.
d. Other SEUS Charges and Switching Fee. Except to the extent identified in this Agreement, SEUS will not impose other recurring or nonrecurring charges. When applicable, the EDC may charge a switching fee to Customer.
e. EDC Charges Customer will incur delivery charges and other service charges from the EDC for its services.
6. Price. The Price for all electricity under this Agreement shall be calculated as described in the Customer Disclosure Statement. For each billing cycle, the Price shall be applied to the Customer's metered usage for such billing cycle (as reported by the EDC).
7. Renewable Energy Products. This paragraph applies if Customer has chosen to receive a voluntary renewable energy product, as outlined in the Customer Disclosure Label. This product bundles electricity with Renewable Energy Certificates ("RECs") in an amount designed to match the Customer's usage. A REC represents the environmental benefits of 1 megawatt hour (MWh) of renewable energy that can be paired with electricity. This product is Green-e ${ }^{\circledR}$ Energy certified and meets the environmental and consumer-protection standards set forth by the nonprofit Center for Resource Solutions. Learn more at www.green-e.org. Election of this product supports the development of renewable resources, but Customer understands and acknowledges that Customer may not actually be supplied with renewable energy.
8. Billing and Payment. At SEUS's option, Customer may receive a single bill each month for both commodity and delivery costs from either SEUS or the EDC ("Consolidated Bill"), or the EDC and SEUS may each invoice Customer separately ("Dual Bill") each month. SEUS will have the right to change the bill type one time during the term of this Agreement. Customer will pay SEUS for electric supply service based on meter readings and consumption information measured by and/or received from Customer's EDC ("Billing Quantity"). For invoices received from SEUS, Customer will pay each invoice in full within 20 days of the invoice date or be subject to a late payment charge of $1.5 \%$, or the highest percentage or amount allowable by law, per month. For invoices received from the EDC, Customer will pay each invoice in full as required by EDC's tariff, or be subject to a late payment charge or disconnection in accordance with the EDC's tariff. If Customer fails to pay either any EDC invoice or any SEUS invoice when due or fails to meet any agreed-upon payment arrangements, then, in addition to any other remedies that it may have, SEUS may terminate this Agreement upon 15 calendar days' written notice to Customer. A $\$ 35$ fee will be charged for all returned payments.

If any payments made by you directly to us are rejected two (2) times in a one-year period, the only form of payment acceptable thereafter will be a certified check, money order, or electronic funds transfer. If you make a payment for a lesser amount, which includes a statement or letter indicating that the lesser payment constitutes full payment, we may accept such payment without prejudice to any other rights or remedies that we may have against you and we may apply it to your account(s) as a partial payment. Customer has the right to request from SEUS, twice within a 12-month period, up to 24 months of the Customer's payment history without charge.
9. Customer Usage Deviation and Behind the Meter Generation. For all customers except residential: If Customer's metered usage during any billing period exceeds, or falls below, its historic usage during a like billing period by $100 \%$ or more, and such variation results in SEUS incurring additional charges, Customer will be responsible for the payment of such additional charges. Customer agrees to inform SEUS of any existing self-generation unit(s), any net metering transactions or any state power allocations associated with the Customer accounts included in this Agreement prior to execution of this Agreement. If Customer fails to provide such notification, SEUS may change the Customer's price or terminate this Agreement. Subsequent to the execution of this Agreement, Customer agrees to promptly provide SEUS with advanced written notice once Customer decides to implement any of the following: (i) changes its use of selfgeneration unit(s), (ii) installation of additional self-generation unit(s); or (iii) addition or amendment of a net metering transaction or state power allocation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Customer shall reimburse SEUS for any costs incurred by SEUS as a result of Customer making any of the changes identified in this paragraph or increases in Customer's capacity or transmission tag due to reduced customer generation output during a tag setting period. . For the avoidance of doubt, consumption bandwidth thresholds established above shall not apply in a manner that would duplicate Customer's cost reimbursement obligations when calculating costs pursuant to this section.
10. Delivery Point, Title, and Taxes. All electricity sold pursuant to this Agreement shall be delivered to a location ("Delivery Point"), which shall constitute the point at which the sale occurs and title to the energy passes to you from us. Customer will be liable for and pay all taxes or surcharges, which are imposed with respect to the sale of electricity after its delivery to the Delivery Point. If Customer is exempt from such taxes, Customer is responsible for identifying and requesting any exemption from the collection of the taxes by providing appropriate documentation to SEUS.
11. Emergency Services. The EDC will continue to respond to emergencies.

If Customer cancels service under this Agreement and returns to the EDC for commodity supply service, Customer may or may not be served under the same rates, terms, and conditions that apply to other customers served by the EDC. Customer acknowledges that in the event of a cancellation or termination of this Agreement, it may take several billing cycles for Customer to return to the EDC for commodity supply service. Customer remains liable for all SEUS charges until Customer's switch to the EDC or another supplier is effective. A final bill will be rendered within 45 days after the final scheduled meter reading by the EDC or if access is unavailable, an estimate of usage will be used in lieu of the final bill, which will be trued-up when the final meter reading is provided.
