# PENNSYLVANIA - ELECTRICITY AND NATURAL GAS SUPPLY AGREEMENT Terms and Conditions 

1. Overview. These Terms and Conditions supplement and form a part of the Agreement between Seller and you, the Customer. Seller agrees to sell, and Customer agrees to buy the quantity of electricity and/or natural supply meeting Customer's full requirements for each Account.
2. Term. Customer acknowledges that (i) the Service Start Date is dependent upon the relevant Utility confirming to Seller that it has completed all required enrollment processes and (ii) if the enrollment processes are completed by a Utility after the Estimated Start Date, the Service Start Date will occur as soon as practicable after the enrollment processes are completed by the Utility, without Seller incurring any liability for such delayed start. The initial term of this Agreement will run from the Service Start Date through the Service End Date ("Initial Term"), unless earlier terminated as provided herein. At the end of the Initial Term, this Agreement shall automatically continue on a month-to-month basis at a Variable Rate, unless and until terminated by either Party upon providing the other Party with 30 days' prior Notice.
3. Customer Charges. For each billing cycle during the Initial Term or any subsequent Term, the amount to be charged to Customer by Seller for each Account shall be the sum of the following: (i) the Commodity Charges, (ii) the amount assessed by Seller for any Cost Components for such billing cycle that are not indicated as being included in the applicable Price for such Account, (iii) all applicable Taxes (except for any Taxes that are expressly included in the Price) and (iv) any costs and charges assessed pursuant to this Agreement (collectively, the "Seller Charges"). After the expiration of the Initial Term, the Price will be a variable month to month price as determined by Seller based on various factors, including but not limited to applicable industry charges, wholesale market conditions, supply sources, seller's margin, and may change monthly without prior notice to Customer, unless provided otherwise in writing signed by both Parties. The Price does not include the costs of distribution and other services provided by the relevant Utility (the "Utility Charges"). Unless otherwise stated herein, prices shall include all cost components associated with compliance with renewable energy requirements mandated by Law.
4. Billing and Payment. With respect to each Account, Customer may receive one consolidated bill from the relevant Utility each bill cycle for both the Utility Charges and the Seller Charges (the "Utility Consolidated Billing" or "UCB") and the bill will be sent to the billing address on file with the Utility. In such case, Customer agrees to remit payment for all amounts reflected on such invoice directly to the Utility in accordance with the Utility's payment terms. Seller reserves the right to immediately terminate the Agreement and supply service in the event that Customer fails to make full payment of the Seller charges when due on any consolidated bill prepared by the Utility. Seller also reserves the right to invoice the customer directly for any and all supply charges in the event that Customer's billing status is changed from Utility Consolidated Billing to dual billing for any reason. Seller may also bill the Customer directly for any reason, and in such case, the Customer agrees to remit payment of all amounts reflected on Seller's invoice directly to Seller no later than 20 days from the date of billing ("Dual Billing Option"). If you are switched to Utility Consolidating Billing from the Dual Billing Option at any time during the term of your Agreement, Indra reserves the right to adjust your rate and pass through any costs imposed on Indra by your local utility due to this change (i.e. "POR costs"). The POR costs incurred by Seller are set by your local distribution utility and made publicly available on the applicable utility's supplier tariff. All invoices will include amounts for applicable Taxes. Depending on the bill format, charges assessed pursuant to this Agreement may appear on Customer's bill as a line item or Price adjustment. Regardless of billing method, invoices may cover multiple Accounts where applicable. Unpaid balances on Customer's account(s) not received by the due date specified on the invoice will be subject to a late charge of the lesser of $1.50 \%$ per month or the maximum permitted by Law ("Interest Rate"). Seller will charge a $\$ 35$ return check fee for all returned checks. Seller is not responsible for notifying Customer of any failed or returned payments. Absent a specific designation from Customer, if multiple balances are due, the payments will be applied to the oldest balance first. Seller may apply any credit balance on a particular Account to a balance owed on any other Account supplied by Seller. Seller will include or cause to be included in any subsequent bill from Seller, adjustments related to previous billings, including estimates, billing or meter read errors, or other errors or omissions. If Customer disputes the Seller Charges on any bill, Customer must pay any undisputed portion of the bill by the applicable due date. If the unpaid, disputed portion of the bill is subsequently resolved in favor of Seller, the Interest Rate will be applied to such unpaid amounts. Failure to make full payment of the Seller's Charges when due will be grounds for termination of the Agreement. Customer will be responsible for the costs of all collection activity, including reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements incurred by Seller in enforcing the terms of this Agreement. Indra reserves the right to apply any collateral posted by customer in connection with this Agreement against any unpaid balances, late fees and penalties incurred on Customer's account in accordance with applicable law.
5. Taxes. Customer shall be responsible for paying all applicable taxes associated with sales under, and/or the performance of, this Agreement. Unless otherwise specified herein, the Price for electricity and/or natural gas herein does not include Taxes; Seller maintains the right to collect any and all applicable Taxes from the Customer, as needed. Where the Customer claims to be tax exempt, Customer shall provide written evidence of any tax exemption to Seller and each relevant Utility before the Service Start Date. Seller may recognize a lawful tax exemption on a prospective basis only after Customer provides proper documentation to Seller. Customer shall be liable for, and shall indemnify Seller against, any Taxes and associated interest or penalties assessed against Seller by any third party due to Customer's failure to timely provide or properly and accurately complete any such evidence.
6. Change in Usage. Customer shall provide Seller with timely Notice of any change in the attributes or use of any Account (including any event) that is likely to result in a load change of $\quad 25 \ldots \ldots \%$ or more (the "Load Change Percentage") as compared to the Forecasted Volume. Examples of such changes may include, but are not limited to equipment outages, shutdowns or replacements, on-site generation, openings or closings, and/or changes in operating hours. Customer shall be responsible for payment of any and all losses, costs and/or charges incurred by Seller resulting from such change and/or exceeding the Load Change Percentage, including, but not limited to, additional ISO or Utility charges (collectively, "Additional Charges").

7. Regulatory Change. If there is a Regulatory Change which causes Seller to incur new or modified fees, costs or charges ("Regulatory Charges"), Seller reserves the right to pass through the Regulatory Charges to Customer without markup. For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties agree that a change in the rate classification of an Account will be deemed a Regulatory Change. The changes described in this Section may impact any or all of the charges described in this Agreement, whether described as "fixed," "variable," "included," "passed through" or otherwise. Regulatory Change means the introduction of any new, or any change in, Law, rules, regulations, orders, rates, charges, Capacity obligations, load profiles, transmission obligations, demand response programs, resource or fuel adequacy programs, renewable portfolio standards or other renewable or clean energy requirements, Utility or ISO operations, market structure, congestion zone design, Utility tariffs Utility policy and/or procedures, and/or ISO rules or protocols.
8. Early Termination. If the Customer fails to timely pay any amount due, Seller shall have the right to immediately terminate the agreement "Event of Default" and (i) designate an early termination date (the "Early Termination Date") to accelerate all amounts owing between the Parties and to liquidate and terminate any or all Transactions (each, a "Terminated Transaction"), (ii) withhold any payments due to Customer and/or (iii) suspend performance of its obligations under this Agreement. Seller may terminate the Agreement even if Customer subsequently cured the Event of Default after such period has expired. In addition to the other remedies specified herein, upon the occurrence of an Event of Default with respect to Customer, Seller shall be permitted to switch Customer to receive Default Service at each Account. Seller's sales of energy supply to Customer at each Account shall be treated as separate transactions (each, a "Transaction") under this Agreement.
9. Termination and/or Load Change Percentage Payment Calculation. On an Early Termination Date, Seller shall close out each Terminated Transaction so that each such Terminated Transaction is canceled and shall calculate and aggregate the Termination Payment for all Terminated Transactions. The Parties agree that a Terminated Transaction will become effective after the Account drop has been processed by the applicable Utility and the Account is no longer supplied under the Agreement and, in case there are multiple Terminated Transactions, the effective termination date will be whichever occurs last (the "Effective Termination Date"). In determining the Termination Payment and/or payment for any costs incurred due to any Load Change Percentage, Seller (i) need not actually enter into replacement transactions, (ii) may utilize the Forecasted Volume or any other Customer-related information it deems relevant to determine the quantity of energy to be purchased by Customer for the remaining term of any Terminated Transactions, and (iii) may consider, among other valuations, any settlement prices of the New York Mercantile Exchange energy futures contracts, internal curves, quotations from leading dealers in energy swap contracts, and other bona fide party bids and offers, which may include, on an arms' length basis, offers from Seller's affiliates, all adjusted for the remainder of the applicable term and basis differentials. Customer shall pay the Termination Payment to Seller within 3 Business Days of Customer's receipt of Notice of the amount thereof from Seller and shall owe any interest accrued at the Interest Rate from the date the Termination Payment is due until paid in full, provided that Seller may set off the amount of any Collateral provided by Customer and held by it under this Agreement against the amount of the Termination Payment. Irrespective of whether a Termination Payment is owed hereunder, Customer shall pay to Seller the Seller's Charges incurred up to the Effective Termination Date. Seller will refund any Collateral surplus after Customer's obligations to Seller have been paid in full. Customer acknowledges and stipulates that the payment obligations set forth herein are difficult to estimate and represent a reasonable approximation of the anticipated harm or loss to Seller as a result of an Event of Default with respect to Customer. Seller reserves all rights, setoffs, counterclaims, combination of accounts, liens and other remedies and defenses which it has or may be entitled to (whether by operation of law or otherwise).
10. Credit. Customer shall provide Seller with financial and other information as Seller may request to complete its credit review, and other contracting processes. Seller reserves the right to not enter into this Agreement in its sole discretion including if: (i) information provided by Customer or its representative (broker/agent) to Seller is incomplete or inaccurate; (ii) the Price listed was not authorized by Seller or rates have changed based on market conditions; (iii) transfer of Customer account(s) is denied or significantly delayed by the Utility; or (iv) Customer does not meet Seller's credit approval criteria. If, at any time during the term of this Agreement, Seller determines that (i) Customer has failed to timely pay any amounts due under this Agreement, or (ii) Seller has reasonable grounds for insecurity with respect to Customer or Customer's creditworthiness, Seller may require that Customer provide (in addition to any Collateral previously provided) Collateral for its obligations under this Agreement. Seller reserves the right to collect Collateral in the form of a deposit equal to the sum of two of the Customer's largest energy usage invoices in the last twelve months at the contracted rate. Customer hereby grants to Seller, as security for the payment and performance of Customer's obligations under this Agreement, a first priority continuing lien and security interest in and to any Collateral (and proceeds and products thereof) that Customer has or may deliver to Seller. When making a request for Collateral, Seller shall comply with its license requirements (if applicable) and any other deposit requirements established by any regulatory body. Any Collateral provided by Customer will be held in accordance with the applicable Law.
11. Renewable Energy. Electricity sold under this Agreement will be supplied from a variety of generating sources, including the electricity provided pursuant to any renewable energy requirements. For electricity plans, your consumption for this product will be offset by RECs from eligible sources including, but not limited to hydro, wind and/or solar generation where applicable. If you choose Voluntary Renewables to be included in your product, Seller will purchase and retire renewable energy certificates ("RECs") to match the applicable percent of your electricity usage, above and beyond any state renewable portfolio standard requirements. If you choose a natural gas plan that includes carbon offsets, a percentage of your natural gas usage (as specified in this Agreement) will be matched with carbon offsets.
12. Information Release Authorization. Customer hereby authorizes Seller to request and obtain account-related data from the Utility, including account name and number, billing and service address, billing and payment history, standard offer service type, rate classification, meter readings, future and historical usage information (including interval meter data), load profile, peak demand and other characteristics of energy service (collectively, "Customer Information"). Customer further agrees that (i) by accepting this Agreement, it is authorizing Utility to release such information to Seller and Seller to disclose the Customer Information as specified in this Agreement; and (ii) the Customer Information exchanged between Seller and the Utility in connection with the energy supply services provided hereunder may be deemed public information for all purposes related to any data security agreement entered into between Seller and the Utility. This

authorization will remain in effect during the term of the Agreement. Seller reserves the right to immediately terminate the Agreement if this authorization changes for any reason.
13. Limitation of Liability: Disclaimer of Warranties: Indemnity.
