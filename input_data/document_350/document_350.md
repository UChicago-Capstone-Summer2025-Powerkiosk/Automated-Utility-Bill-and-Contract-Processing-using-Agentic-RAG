Smart meters are safe, and will provide our electric customers with many benefits. They use low power radio frequency (RF) that is generally far less than that used by everyday items like baby monitors, cell phones, microwaves, TVs and wireless routers. To learn more, go to pseg.com/smartmeters.

All PSE\&G employees carry identification cards with their picture on it. For your safety, ask to see the ID card of any PSE\&G employee visiting your home or business.
