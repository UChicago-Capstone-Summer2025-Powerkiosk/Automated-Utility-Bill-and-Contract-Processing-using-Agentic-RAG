Incremental Pricing: All fixed quantities listed herein in combination with any prior transactions and nominated quantities made prior to the month of flow will be divided by the number of days in each Flow Month and rounded to the nearest whole number with the last day's volume adjusted to equal the monthly total, which will be the "Baseload Daily Volume." For all additional quantities required by Customer each flow day in excess of the Baseload Daily Volume, the price shall be based on the Platts Gas Daily "Final Daily Price Survey" Midpoint price for the applicable

index each day plus $\$ 0.10000 / \mathrm{MMBtu}$.
For any gas quantities bought back from Customer by Constellation each day due to Customer's requirements being less than the Baseload Daily Volume, the price shall be based on the Platts Gas Daily "Final Daily Price Survey" Midpoint for the applicable index for that day minus \$-0.10000/MMBtu.

At invoicing, Customer will potentially see two line items on their monthly invoice related to Incremental Pricing. For all days where Customer's requirements were more than the Baseload Daily Volume, Customer will receive one line item showing the total volume and the actual weighted average cost of gas ("WACOG") based on the above pricing. For all days where Customer's requirements were less than the Baseload Daily Volume, Customer will receive one line item showing the total volume and the actual weighted average cost of gas ("WACOG") based on the above pricing.

## Applicable Platts Gas Daily Index = Cheyenne Hub - High

Should an operational flow order, or other utility or pipeline restrictions occur, Constellation will attempt to adjust Customer's daily nomination to match expected usage as determined by Constellation. The pricing of incremental volumes associated with the nomination adjustment will be based on then current spot market price, as determined by Constellation in its reasonable discretion.

If Constellation and Customer have previously entered into any commodity transaction(s) for the Facility (the "Previous Transaction") that overlap one or more of the delivery months covered in this Transaction Confirmation (the "Overlapping Month(s)"), the incremental gas pricing in this Transaction Confirmation shall apply to the Overlapping Months instead of any conflicting incremental gas pricing associated with the Previous Transaction.

Allocation: Constellation will allocate the Contract Quantity listed herein among the Customer's separate facilities or meters at a later date.
