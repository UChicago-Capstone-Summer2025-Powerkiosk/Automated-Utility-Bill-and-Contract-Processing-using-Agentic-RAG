THIS MASTER COMMERCIAL GAS SALES AGREEMENT (this "Master Agreement") is entered into as of the Effective Date described below by and between Mansfield Power and Gas, LLC ("Supplier"), and the customer for retail natural gas supply and transportation services identified on the signature page hereto ("Customer"). Each of Supplier and Customer may be referred to herein individually as a "Party" and collectively as the "Parties."

1. Transactions. This Master Agreement sets forth the general terms and conditions governing transactions for the purchase, sale and transportation of natural gas and related products and services (each a "Transaction") to one or more of Customer's service locations (each, a "Point of Service Location") as agreed to from time to time and specified in Exhibit B to a Transaction Confirmation. Each Transaction shall be evidenced by a written transaction confirmation (each a "Confirmation") in the form set forth in Exhibit A. If Customer fails to object in writing to any term in the Confirmation within five (5) Business Days of receipt of the Confirmation, the Confirmation shall constitute the definitive written expression of the Transaction. Each Confirmation shall constitute part of and shall be subject to this Master Agreement. Nothing in this Agreement obligates either Party to enter into a Transaction at any time. This Agreement, all Exhibits thereto, and each Confirmation shall constitute a single integrated agreement between the Parties (collectively referred to as the "Agreement").
2. Services. Commencing on the Delivery Start Date set forth in a Confirmation and continuing throughout the Term, Customer appoints Supplier as its exclusive agent for the supply and/or transportation of natural gas to Customer's Point of Service Locations. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Supplier shall acquire and transport to Customer, and Customer shall purchase and receive, the Contract Quantity of natural gas of the relevant local gas distribution company ("LDC") specified in a Confirmation in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. If the LDC requires Customer to install additional metering and/or related equipment at any Point of Service Location, Customer shall be solely responsible for the costs and installation thereof. Title to all natural gas hereunder shall pass from Supplier to Customer at the Delivery Point and Customer shall have the sole responsibility for transporting gas from the Delivery Point.
2.1 Customer Qualification. Customer acknowledges and agrees that Supplier's duty to provide natural gas under any Confirmation that would require the use of an LDC's facilities is contingent upon the applicable Customer Point of Service Location qualifying for the LDC's appropriate rate or tariff schedule that would permit the use of the LDC's facilities for delivering the natural gas to that Customer Point of Service Location.
2.2 Nominations. The Parties shall coordinate nomination activities such that the deadlines of the transporter of gas by a gas gathering or pipeline company or LDC (each a "Transporter") may be met. If Customer or the LDC fails to provide Supplier with a usage nomination for any month in a timely manner, Supplier (i) may establish a nomination for such month in a commercially reasonable manner based on Customer's historical
usage data available to Supplier, and (ii) shall have the right to use and rely on such nomination unless notified otherwise by Customer or the LDC. If Supplier or Customer becomes aware that actual deliveries are greater or lesser than the quantity of gas confirmed by a Transporter, such Party shall promptly notify the other Party.
2.3 Imbalances. The Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to avoid imposition of any fees, penalties, cash-outs, costs or charges (in cash or in kind) assessed by a Transporter for failure to satisfy balancing and/or nomination requirements ("Imbalance Charges"). If Supplier or Customer receives an invoice from a Transporter that includes Imbalance Charges, the Parties shall determine the validity and cause of such Imbalance Charges. The Party causing the imposition of the Imbalance Charges will be responsible to pay such Imbalance Charges.
2.4 Transporter Restrictions. If either Party receives an operational flow order or any other usage or operating instructions, restrictions or similar notice (each an "OFO") from a Transporter requiring action to be taken in connection with the transportation or consumption of gas pursuant to a Transaction, such Party will use commercially reasonable efforts to notify the other Party of such event in a timely manner. Such notice may be given by electronic means. E ach Party will take all commercially reasonable actions required by the OFO within the time prescribed. If OFO penalties, charges, fees, costs or expenses result from the actions or inactions of one Party, then such Party shall be solely responsible for any such penalties, charges, fees, costs or expenses. Both parties agree that OFOs may require one or both parties to buy or sell quantities of natural gas in the then-current market conditions, which may be appreciably higher or lower than the Contract Price specified in a Transaction. If Supplier is responsible for nominations and balancing on a Transporter imposing an OFO or similar restriction, Supplier may (but is not required to) increase or decrease nominations, as appropriate, to avoid penalties.
3. Defined Terms. Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the meaning set forth in Section 30.
4. Pricing. The price for the natural gas delivered hereunder (the "Contract Price") is set forth in a Confirmation, based upon Customer's Forecast Usage data, and applies to all natural gas covered under such Confirmation and includes charges for the supply, nomination and balancing associated with the transportation of natural gas, as specified in such Confirmation and in Section 11 herein.
5. Billing and Payment.
5.1 General Billing and Payment Terms: Supplier shall provide monthly invoices, either through utility

consolidated billing ("UCB"), supplier consolidated billing ("SCB") or a Dual Billing Option ("DBO"), at its sole discretion to the extent permitted by law. Supplier may estimate bills in cases where actual billing determinants are unavailable. The billed quantity will then be adjusted to the actual quantity on the following Month's billing or as soon thereafter as actual delivery information is available. Customer shall pay all amounts owing by the Due Date specified in a Confirmation. Supplier shall credit account for all overpayments. Late payments shall incur interest charges at a rate of interest equal to the lower of a per annum rate of one and one-half percent per month ( $1.5 \%$ ) or the maximum applicable lawful interest rate. In any instance where any payment to Supplier is declined by the issuing institution, Customer shall be assessed a non-sufficient funds charge of $\$ 35$ or the maximum allowed under applicable law (whichever is less) per declined payment. Customer shall be liable for all costs incurred by Supplier, including reasonable attorneys' fees, for collections on accounts greater than thirty (30) calendar days past due.
5.2 Disputes and Adjustments of Invoices: Customer may dispute, in good faith and in writing, the correctness of any invoice. In the event that an invoice or portion thereof is disputed, payment of the undisputed portion of the invoice shall be made by the Due Date specified on a Confirmation, with notice of the dispute given to Supplier in writing and stating the amount and basis for the dispute. Supplier and Customer agree to use good faith and reasonable efforts to resolve any such billing/invoice dispute within thirty calendar (30) days of Supplier's receipt of Customer's written notice of any such dispute. Upon resolution of the dispute, any required payment shall be made within ten (10) Business Customer must provide Supplier with written notice of any disputed charge(s) on or prior to the Due Date of the invoice or it will be deemed to have waived its rights to dispute such a charge. In addition, Supplier shall not retroactively charge any additional amounts to any timely paid Customer invoice, provided the aforementioned shall not limit Supplier's ability to adjust Customer's invoice as provided in Section 5.1 herein.
5.3 Payments: The default method of payment shall be through the Automated Clearing House ("ACH") Recurring Payment Authorization attached herein or provided separately at Customer's request. Customer agrees to provide ACH processing details required to process such payments. No processing fee shall be assessed by Supplier when using ACH recurring payments.
6. Term. The term of this Master Agreement will commence on the Effective Date and, unless terminated earlier as provided in this Master Agreement, will continue until terminated by either Party upon thirty (30) days prior written notice to the other Party; provided this Master Agreement shall remain in full force and effect during the term of any Confirmation. Each Confirmation shall set forth the applicable "Delivery Period" or term during which deliveries of natural gas are to be made. Supplier shall not be liable for any failure to enroll or drop a Point of Service Location by any applicable start and end date(s) set forth in the Confirmation
due to circumstances beyond its control. Further, all obligations regarding indemnity, payment of Taxes, limitations of liability, remedies afforded to the Parties after default and early termination, confidentiality obligations, and waivers survive for the period of the applicable statute of limitations.
7. Renewal of Agreement. Unless otherwise set forth on Exhibit C, not less than thirty (30) days prior to the anticipated expiration date of the then current relevant Delivery Period, Supplier may provide a Confirmation renewal notice electronically or otherwise in writing containing proposed pricing, terms and conditions for a new Confirmation (the "Renewal Notice"). If, following termination or expiration of any Confirmation, any of Customer's Point of Service Locations remain designated by any LDC as being served by Supplier, then Supplier may either (a) continue to serve such Point of Service Location on a month-to-month holdover basis (each, a "Holdover Term"). Any such Holdover Term may be terminated by either party upon no less than thirty days written notice, unless otherwise expressly provided herein. The price payable during any Holdover Term shall be based on a variable rate, and may change monthly due to current and predicted weather patterns, retail competition, wholesale natural gas costs, fluctuations in natural gas supply and demand, industry regulations, pricing strategies, costs to serve customers, and many other factors. Variable rate agreements will automatically renew on a month-to month basis and can be cancelled at any time by either party without any early termination fee. This Agreement shall continue to govern the provision of service during any Holdover Term.
8. Performance Assurance. If either party (" $X$ ") has reasonable grounds for insecurity regarding the performance of any obligation under this Contract (whether or not then due) by the other party ("Y") (including, without limitation, the occurrence of a material change in the creditworthiness of $Y$ or its Guarantor, if applicable), X may demand Performance Assurance. Performance Assurance shall mean sufficient security in the form, amount, for a term, and from an issuer, all as reasonably acceptable to $X$, including, but not limited to cash, a standby irrevocable letter of credit, a prepayment, a security interest in an asset or guaranty. $Y$ hereby grants to $X$ a continuing first priority security interest in, lien on, and right of setoff against all Performance Assurance in the form of cash transferred by $Y$ to $X$ pursuant to this Section 8. Upon the return by $X$ to $Y$ of such Performance Assurance, the security interest and lien granted hereunder on that Performance Assurance shall be released automatically and, to the extent possible, without any further action by either party.
9. Consent to Disclosure. Customer designates Supplier as an authorized recipient of Customer's account, billing and usage information. Customer consents to the disclosure by each LDC to Supplier of certain basic information about Customer including: account number, meter number, meter read data, rate class, natural gas usage, billing and payment information, account name, service address, billing address, and telephone number.
10. Transportation. Customer agrees and acknowledges that Supplier does not own or control any of the transmission or distribution facilities used to transport natural gas to the Point of Service Location(s). The LDC has the

responsibility to deliver the natural gas to the Point of Service Location(s). Supplier has no obligation, liability, or responsibility for the operations of the LDC, for the interruption of service, or for the LDC's failure to deliver natural gas to the Point of Service Location(s).
11.

Point of Service Location Usage. Prior to entering into a Transaction, Customer will provide to Supplier information reasonably required to substantiate its usage requirements, including information regarding its meter/account numbers, historical/projected usage for a period of at least one year, time of use, hours of operation, and LDC rate classes, which in substantial part form the basis for the calculation of charges for any Transaction. Customer shall provide Supplier at least sixty (60) calendar days prior written notice prior to removing any Point of Service Location from service hereunder as a result of reducing or ceasing operations at such Point of Service Location; including, but not limited to, closing any Point of Service Location or the sale of any Point of Service Location to an unrelated third party. Customer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to operate Customer's Facilities such that natural gas consumption is consistent with Customer's Forecast Usage. Customer shall notify Supplier as soon as practicable of: (i) any revision to the Forecast Usage; (ii) all scheduled or unscheduled outages or anticipated changes in usage; (iii) any anticipated Material Usage Deviations; and (iv) any removal of a Customer's Point of Service Location from service hereunder during the Delivery Period specified in a Transaction. Customer shall be responsible to Supplier for any additional costs and losses incurred by Supplier arising from (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv); provided that Supplier shall use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate any such costs after receipt of such notice. Supplier may within ten (10) days of receipt of Customer's notice of a Material Usage Deviation, assess the changes in Customer's usage and if applicable, declare an Effective Removal of the affected Point of Service Location(s).
12. Taxes. All applicable Taxes shall be passed through from Supplier to Customer without markup.
13. Confidentiality. Neither Party shall disclose, unless authorized in writing by the other Party, the terms of this Agreement to a third party (other than the Party's employees or its lenders, counselors or accountants who have agreed to keep such terms confidential) except in order to comply with any applicable law, order, regulation or exchange rule, to collect debts owed or to obtain transmission, distribution, ancillary or other regulated services; provided, however, that each Party will notify the other Party of any proceeding of which it is aware which may result in non-routine disclosure. Each of the Parties shall be entitled to all remedies available at law or in equity to enforce, or seek relief in connection with, this confidentiality obligation; provided, however, that monetary damages shall be limited to the amounts specified in Section 23 of this Agreement, and a breach of this section shall not give rise to a right to suspend or terminate this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Customer agrees to permit Supplier to utilize Customer's name as a customer of Supplier solely for marketing and publicity purposes.
14. Notices. Exhibit C contains the contact information for Supplier and Customer that will be used to provide any and all notices arising from this Agreement. All notices will be made in writing and may be delivered by hand delivery, first class mail (postage prepaid), overnight courier service or by facsimile and will be effective upon receipt; provided, however, that any default or termination notice may only be sent by hand or by overnight courier service.

## 15. Events of Default.

15.1 Customer Default. If a Customer Default occurs, Supplier may, at its option and in its sole discretion, choose to suspend or terminate this Agreement in its entirety or as to any Point of Service Location(s) or any Confirmation. Any such suspension or termination shall take place after Customer's receipt of written notice stating the reason(s) for any such suspension or termination and providing the anticipated effective date the foregoing will take effect (the "Early Termination Date"). In the event of Supplier's termination for Customer Default, Supplier shall be entitled to receive from Customer a Customer Early Termination Payment. Supplier shall calculate the Customer Early Termination Payment in its commercially reasonable discretion, including where applicable, Supplier's estimates of market prices and forward market prices. Such calculation shall be provided to Customer by Supplier as of the Early Termination Date and Customer shall pay the Customer Early Termination Payment on the later of the Early Termination Date or five (5) Business Days after such calculation is received.
15.2 Supplier Default. In the event of a Supplier Default, Customer shall provide Supplier written notice of its intent to terminate this Agreement or a Confirmation in its entirety or as to any specific Point of Service Location(s) thereunder, provided however that the Early Termination Date shall not be less than thirty (30) days from Supplier's receipt of Customer's notice of Supplier Default.

The Supplier Early Termination Payment shall be paid by Supplier within five (5) Business Days after such notice is received.
15.3 Mitigation of Damages. Each Party agrees that it has a duty to mitigate damages and to use commercially reasonable efforts to minimize any damages it may incur as a result of the other Party's performance or nonperformance of this Agreement. Supplier and Customer acknowledge and agree that the Supplier Early Termination Payment and the Customer Early Termination Payment each constitutes a reasonable approximation of harm or loss, and is not a penalty or punitive in any respect.
16. Force Majeure. The non-Claiming Party upon the occurrence of a Force Majeure event shall not be required to perform its obligations to the Claiming Party for the period of the Force Majeure; provided, however, that Force Majeure shall not excuse Customer's failure to make payments in a timely manner for the natural gas supplied by Supplier before a Force Majeure event or during a Force Majeure event

provided the natural gas is transported and distributed by the LDC and received pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. If the Force Majeure continues for a period in excess of thirty (30) calendar days (an "Extended Force Majeure Event"), the performing Party may terminate this Agreement by providing the other Party written notice of the early termination, without the termination for an Extended Force Majeure Event constituting an Customer Default or a Supplier Default.
17. Governing Law and Waiver of Jury Trial. This Agreement will be interpreted in accordance with the substantive laws of the State of point of service without giving effect to laws and rules governing conflicts of laws. THE PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OF ANY SIZE IS IRREVOCABLY WAVED.
18. Relationship of Parties. Supplier is an independent contractor, and nothing in this Agreement establishes a joint venture, fiduciary relationship, partnership or other joint undertaking. Supplier is not acting as Customer's consultant or advisor, and Customer shall not rely on Supplier in evaluating the advantages or disadvantages of any specific product or service, predictions about future natural gas prices or any other matter.
19. Changes in Law or Regulation. In the event that any change in any statute, rule, regulation, order or other law, or procedure, tariff, rate class or other process or charge, promulgated by any governmental authority or LDC or other regulated service provider, alters to the detriment of Supplier its costs to perform or its economic returns under this Agreement or a Confirmation (a "Negative Change in Regulation"), Supplier may revise the pricing under such Confirmation to eliminate the impact of such Negative Change in Regulation. Before any such price revision, Supplier shall provide written notice to Customer of the Negative Change in Regulation, the resulting price revisions, and the date upon which such revised pricing shall be effective. Customer shall pay the revised price described in such notice, and all other terms and conditions of the applicable Confirmation and this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.
20. Severability. The various provisions of this Agreement are severable. Any provision or section of this Agreement declared or rendered void, unlawful, or otherwise unenforceable shall not otherwise affect the, residual, lawful obligations that arise under this Agreement.

Payment Terms: Utility Consolidated Billing: Payment to Utility is due on or before the Utility invoice due date.

Supplier shall calculate Customer's invoice based on Customer's actual usage.

Each invoice is also subject to adjustment for errors in arithmetic, computation, meter readings or other errors, provided that interest shall not accrue on such adjustments. As supplemented by this Transaction Confirmation, all other Terms and Conditions contained in the Agreement remain in full force and effect.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed this Agreement effective the day and year first above written.
