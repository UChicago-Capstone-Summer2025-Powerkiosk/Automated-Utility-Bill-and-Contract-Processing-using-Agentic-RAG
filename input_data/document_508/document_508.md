You must continue to pay your current charges while your complaint is under review to keep your service turned on.
If you are not able to pay your bill, call PG\&E to discuss how we can help.

## Important definitions

Rotating outage blocks are subject to change without advance notice due to operational conditions.
Tier 1/Baseline allowance: Some residential rates are given a Tier 1/Baseline allowance - a CPUC approved percentage of average customer usage during summer and winter months. Your Tier 1/Baseline allowance provides for basic needs at an affordable price and encourages conservation. Your allowance is assigned based on the climate where you live, the season and your heat source. As you use more energy, you pay more for usage. Any usage over your baseline allowance will be charged at a higher price.
Wildfire Fund Charge: Charge on behalf of the State of California Department of Water Resources (DWR) to fund the California Wildfire Fund. For usage prior to October 1, 2020, this charge included costs related to the 2001 California energy crisis, also collected on behalf of the DWR. These charges belong to DWR, not PG\&E.

## Understanding SJCE Charges

SJCE replaces PG\&E Generation Charges. PG\&E continues to provide all electric delivery, billing, and gas services. Under PG\&E Electric Delivery Charges, note the Generation Credit. This is what PG\&E would have charged for power, and now credits back to you. The PG\&E Power Charge Indifference Adjustment and Franchise Fee are factored into SJCE's rate-setting. Learn more.

SJ Cares is SJCE's program that allows customers enrolled in CARE or FERA financial assistance programs to receive cleaner energy at the lowest possible rates. Learn more: www.SanJoseCleanEnergy.org/Discount-Pro grams.

Please pay your SJCE charges directly to PG\&E (see page 1 of this bill). Do not send payment to San José Clean Energy.

If you believe there is an error or have a question in your Gas Service Provider's gas procurement charges, please call your Gas Service Provider at the number listed on your bill. If you are not satisfied with their response, please contact the CPUC's Consumer Affairs Branch at 1-800-649-7570. If you have limitations hearing or speaking, a specially-trained Communications Assistant can relay telephone conversations for all of your calls. Dial 711 to reach the California Relay Service.

COMMERCIAL ENERGY cannot turn off your service for nonpayment while your complaint is under review. However, you must continue to pay your current charges to avoid disconnection of your service.
