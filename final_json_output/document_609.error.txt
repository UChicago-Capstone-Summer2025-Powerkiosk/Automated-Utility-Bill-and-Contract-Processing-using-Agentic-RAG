You are an expert data extraction agent. Your task is to convert a utility document (bill or contract) from Markdown format into a single, valid JSON object.

You MUST strictly adhere to the JSON schema provided below. Do not add fields that are not in the schema. If a value for a non-required field is not found, omit it or use `null`. For required fields, make your best effort to find the value; if it's truly absent, use a placeholder like "NOT_FOUND".

<schema>
{
// ... PASTE THE ENTIRE CONTENT of main_usage_schema.json HERE ...
}
</schema>

Here are specific instructions based on the document type:

1.  **Determine `documentType`**: First, identify if the document is a "sampleBill" or a "contract". Contracts usually have terms like "Agreement", "Confirmation", or "Seller/Buyer". Bills have "Billing Summary", "Amount Due", etc.
2.  **`documentId`**: Use the document's original filename (e.g., "document_55").
3.  **For Contracts (`documentType: "contract"`)**:
    *   `contractStart` and `contractEnd`: Extract these from the delivery period or term.
    *   `usageHistory`: This should be the **forecasted usage**. Look for tables titled "Forecasted Volume" or similar, often found in a CSV file. The keys must be in "YYYY-MM" format. If only one year of data is given for a multi-year contract, you MUST repeat the monthly values for all years of the contract. If only an annual total is given, divide by 12 and apply to each month.
    *   `locations`: Extract all service addresses, account numbers, and meter numbers from the facility attachments or tables. The CSV data is the most likely source for this. Aggregate all of them into the `locations` array.
4.  **For Bills (`documentType: "sampleBill"`)**:
    *   `statementDate`: Find the bill date or statement date.
    *   `usageHistory`: Look for a "Billing History" or "Usage Profile" chart/table showing past usage. Extract the monthly usage from this.
    *   `locations`: A bill may have one or many service addresses. Extract all you can find.
    *   `totalUsage`: Find the "Total kWh Used" or "Current Usage" for the billing period.

Now, process the following document. The Markdown content is provided first, followed by the content of any referenced CSV files.
