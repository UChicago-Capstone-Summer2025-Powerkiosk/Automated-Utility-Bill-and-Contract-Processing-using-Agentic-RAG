You are an expert data extraction agent. Your task is to convert a utility document (bill or contract) from Markdown format into a single, valid JSON object.

You MUST strictly adhere to the JSON schema provided below. Do not add fields that are not in the schema. If a value for a non-required field is not found, omit it or use `null`. For required fields, make your best effort to find the value; if it's truly absent, use a placeholder like "NOT_FOUND".

<schema>
{
// ... PASTE THE ENTIRE CONTENT of main_usage_schema.json HERE ...
}
</schema>

Here are specific instructions based on the document type:

1.  **Determine `documentType`**: First, identify if the document is a "sampleBill" or a "contract". Contracts usually have terms like "Agreement", "Confirmation", or "Seller/Buyer". Bills have "Billing Summary", "Amount Due", etc.
2.  **`documentId`**: Use the document's original filename (e.g., "document_55").
3.  **For Contracts (`documentType: "contract"`)**:
    *   `contractStart` and `contractEnd`: Extract these from the delivery period or term.
    *   `usageHistory`: This should be the **forecasted usage**. Look for tables titled "Forecasted Volume" or similar, often found in a CSV file. The keys must be in "YYYY-MM" format. If only one year of data is given for a multi-year contract, you MUST repeat the monthly values for all years of the contract. If only an annual total is given, divide by 12 and apply to each month.
    *   `locations`: Extract all service addresses, account numbers, and meter numbers from the facility attachments or tables. The CSV data is the most likely source for this. Aggregate all of them into the `locations` array.
4.  **For Bills (`documentType: "sampleBill"`)**:
    *   `statementDate`: Find the bill date or statement date.
    *   `usageHistory`: Look for a "Billing History" or "Usage Profile" chart/table showing past usage. Extract the monthly usage from this.
    *   `locations`: A bill may have one or many service addresses. Extract all you can find.
    *   `totalUsage`: Find the "Total kWh Used" or "Current Usage" for the billing period.

Now, process the following document. The Markdown content is provided first, followed by the content of any referenced CSV files.

If you believe there is an error on your bill, please call 1-800-743-5000 to speak with a representative. If you are not satisfied with our response, contact the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC), Consumer Affairs Branch (CAB), 505 Van Ness Avenue, Room 2003, San Francisco, CA 94102, 1-800-649-7570 or 7-1-1 (8:30 AM to 4:30 PM, Monday through Friday) or by visiting www.cpuc.ca.gov/complaints/.

To avoid having service turned off while you wait for the outcome of a complaint to the CPUC specifically regarding the accuracy of your bill, please contact CAB for assistance. If your case meets the eligibility criteria, CAB will provide you with instructions on how to mail a check or money order to be impounded pending resolution of your case. You must continue to pay your current charges while your complaint is under review to keep your service turned on.
If you are not able to pay your bill, call PG\&E to discuss how we can help. You may qualify for reduced rates under PG\&E's CARE program or other special programs and agencies may be available to assist you. You may qualify for PG\&E's Energy Savings Assistance Program which is an energy efficiency program for income-qualified residential customers.

## Important definitions

Rotating outage blocks are subject to change without advance notice due to operational conditions.
Tier 1/Baseline allowance: Some residential rates are given a Tier 1/Baseline allowance - a CPUC approved percentage of average customer usage during summer and winter months. Your Tier 1/Baseline allowance provides for basic needs at an affordable price and encourages conservation. Your allowance is assigned based on the climate where you live, the season and your heat source. As you use more energy, you pay more for usage. Any usage over your baseline allowance will be charged at a higher price.
Wildfire Fund Charge: Charge on behalf of the State of California Department of Water Resources (DWR) to fund the California Wildfire Fund. For usage prior to October 1, 2020, this charge included costs related to the 2001 California energy crisis, also collected on behalf of the DWR. These charges belong to DWR, not PG\&E.

About San José Clean Energy (SJCE)
San José Clean Energy is a program of the City of San José and provides its residents and businesses with electricity from sources like solar, wind, and hydropower. SJCE offers the additional benefits of customer choice, community programs, local control, transparency, and accountability.

SJCE's standard electricity generation service, GreenSource, provides customers with more renewable power. SJCE also offers a 100\% renewable product, TotalGreen, for a small premium. Learn more.
www.SanJoseCleanEnergy.org/TotalGreen.

## Understanding SJCE Charges

SJCE replaces PG\&E Generation Charges. PG\&E continues to provide all electric delivery, billing, and gas services. Under PG\&E Electric Delivery Charges, note the Generation Credit. This is what PG\&E would have charged for power, and now credits back to you. The PG\&E Power Charge Indifference Adjustment and Franchise Fee are factored into SJCE's rate-setting. Learn more.
www.SanJoseCleanEnergy.org/Understandin g-Your-Bill.

SJ Cares is SJCE's program that allows customers enrolled in CARE or FERA financial assistance programs to receive cleaner energy at the lowest possible rates. Learn more: www.SanJoseCleanEnergy.org/Discount-Pro grams.

Please pay your SJCE charges directly to PG\&E (see page 1 of this bill). Do not send payment to San José Clean Energy.

About San José Clean Energy (SJCE)
San José Clean Energy is a program of the City of San José and provides its residents and businesses with electricity from sources like solar, wind, and hydropower. SJCE offers the additional benefits of customer choice, community programs, local control, transparency, and accountability.

SJCE's standard electricity generation service, GreenSource, provides customers with more renewable power. SJCE also offers a 100\% renewable product, TotalGreen, for a small premium. Learn more.
www.SanJoseCleanEnergy.org/TotalGreen.

## Understanding SJCE Charges

SJCE replaces PG\&E Generation Charges. PG\&E continues to provide all electric delivery, billing, and gas services. Under PG\&E Electric Delivery Charges, note the Generation Credit. This is what PG\&E would have charged for power, and now credits back to you. The PG\&E Power Charge Indifference Adjustment and Franchise Fee are factored into SJCE's rate-setting. Learn more.
www.SanJoseCleanEnergy.org/Understandin g-Your-Bill.

SJ Cares is SJCE's program that allows customers enrolled in CARE or FERA financial assistance programs to receive cleaner energy at the lowest possible rates. Learn more: www.SanJoseCleanEnergy.org/Discount-Pro grams.

Please pay your SJCE charges directly to PG\&E (see page 1 of this bill). Do not send payment to San José Clean Energy.

## Understanding SJCE Charges

SJ Cares is SJCE's program that allows customers enrolled in CARE or FERA financial assistance programs to receive cleaner energy at the lowest possible rates. Learn more: www.SanJoseCleanEnergy.org/Discount-Pro grams.

Please pay your SJCE charges directly to PG\&E (see page 1 of this bill). Do not send payment to San José Clean Energy.

About San José Clean Energy (SJCE)
San José Clean Energy is a program of the City of San José and provides its residents and businesses with electricity from sources like solar, wind, and hydropower. SJCE offers the additional benefits of customer choice, community programs, local control, transparency, and accountability.

SJCE's standard electricity generation service, GreenSource, provides customers with more renewable power. SJCE also offers a 100\% renewable product, TotalGreen, for a small premium. Learn more.
www.SanJoseCleanEnergy.org/TotalGreen.

## Understanding SJCE Charges

SJCE replaces PG\&E Generation Charges. PG\&E continues to provide all electric delivery, billing, and gas services. Under PG\&E Electric Delivery Charges, note the Generation Credit. This is what PG\&E would have charged for power, and now credits back to you. The PG\&E Power Charge Indifference Adjustment and Franchise Fee are factored into SJCE's rate-setting. Learn more.
www.SanJoseCleanEnergy.org/Understandin g-Your-Bill.

SJ Cares is SJCE's program that allows customers enrolled in CARE or FERA financial assistance programs to receive cleaner energy at the lowest possible rates. Learn more: www.SanJoseCleanEnergy.org/Discount-Pro grams.

Please pay your SJCE charges directly to PG\&E (see page 1 of this bill). Do not send payment to San José Clean Energy.
