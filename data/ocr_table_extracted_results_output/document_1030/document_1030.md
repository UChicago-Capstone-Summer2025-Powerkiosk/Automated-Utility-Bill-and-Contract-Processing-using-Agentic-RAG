## Your usage snapshot

![](images/img-0.jpeg)

The image is a line chart titled "Gas usage history" with the y-axis labeled "CCF" and the x-axis showing months from November to November. The chart compares gas usage between 2019 and 2020. 

- The 2019 line starts high in November and decreases steadily until May, then slightly increases towards November.
- The 2020 line starts lower than 2019, follows a similar pattern, and ends slightly higher in November.

Below the chart, a table provides additional data:
- **Current Month**: 23,870 CCF
- **Nov 2019**: 42,330 CCF
- **12-Month Usage**: 310,050 CCF
- **Avg Monthly Usage**: 25,838 CCF

The note below the table states: "12-month usage based on most recent history."

The chart uses blue for 2019 and green for 2020, with the 2020 line highlighted. This represents a **yearly usage breakdown (monthly-based)**.

Thank you for your payment.
Duke Energy does not maintain customers' natural gas piping after or downstream of the meter. You should maintain such piping by periodically inspecting for leaks. If the piping is metal, you should also check for signs of corrosion. You should repair such piping if leaks or corrosion are discovered. For assistance locating, inspecting or repairing buried piping, please contact a licensed heating/plumbing contractor. You should always call 811 prior to digging. Once your lines are marked, always dig by hand if digging near natural gas piping.

Mail your payment at least 7 days before the due date or pay instantly at duke-energy.com/billing. Late payments are subject to a $1.5 \%$ late charge.

Please return this portion with your payment. Thank you for your business.

## Important to know

## Your next meter reading: Dec 29

Please be sure we can safely access your meter for actual readings. Don't worry if your digital meter flashes eights from time to time. That's a normal part of the energy measuring process.

## Your electric service may be disconnected if your payment is past due

If payment for your electric service is past due, we may begin disconnection procedures. If your service is disconnected because of a missed payment, you must pay the amount specified in the Important Disconnect Information section on your bill, as well as, a reconnection fee, before your service will be reconnected. The reconnection fee is $\$ 10$ for electric service that may be reconnected remotely, $\$ 69$ for electric service that is not eligible to be reconnected remotely, and $\$ 17$ for gas service. In such situations where both electric and gas service are disconnected for non-payment, the reconnection fee will not exceed $\$ 27$ for both.

## Failure to pay may result in a return to our standard offer for generation

Failure to pay charges for a competitive retail service may result in cancellation of your contract with the respective retail electric supplier. You will then be returned to Duke Energy Ohio's standard offer for generation services.

## Questions or complaints

If you have a question or complaint about your bill or service, please contact us via one of the contact options provided.

If your complaint is not resolved after contacting Duke Energy or if you need general utility information, please contact the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO) or the Ohio Consumers' Counsel (OCC) via one of the contacts provided.

## When you pay by check

We may process the payment as a regular check or convert it into a one-time electronic check payment.

One centum cubic foot (CCF) is the amount of gas in a 100-cubicfoot space. If you have a standard oven, it would take about 20 hours to use 1 CCF of gas.
A multiplier is the factor that the meter reading is multiplied by to determine the correct energy usage.
