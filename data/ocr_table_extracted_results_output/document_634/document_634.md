## 2021 Drinking Water Report Available Online

Drinking water quality is a top priority at Citizens Energy Group. Many significant efforts and investments are made to ensure the water supplied to our customers is safe to drink. These efforts include the protection of our water sources, quality control in the water treatment process, and maintenance of the water distribution system. We conduct testing every day to confirm the quality and safety of your drinking water supply.

Each year, we measure and report our compliance with drinking water regulations in a document called the Water Quality Report. To review the 2021 Water Quality Report, visit www.CitizensEnergyGroup.com/WaterQuality or scan the QR code with your smartphone.

## Safety Tip

If you detect even a slight odor of natural gas in the area, don't stay-get away. Then contact Citizens Energy Group at (317) 924-3311 or call 911.

## Summer Sewer Charges

On May 1, Citizens launched its annual Summer Sewer Charges program for residential customers. This program considers that some water used during the summer months may not be disposed of in the wastewater system, such as water used for lawn irrigation. Therefore, from May through November, the residential sewer charge will be based on the customer's average water usage during the months of December through March.

However, under no circumstances will the sewer charge be based on fewer than 3,000 gallons (4CCF) of water. Residential customers will see a line item on their bill labeled: Sewer Charges (xx CCF). This represents the sewer volume used to calculate sewer charges. No further action is needed by customers as enrollment in the program is automatic.
