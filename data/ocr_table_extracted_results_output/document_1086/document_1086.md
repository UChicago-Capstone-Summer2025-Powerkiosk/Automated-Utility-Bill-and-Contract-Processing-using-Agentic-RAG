This Commodity Master Agreement ("CMA") among Direct Energy Business, LLC, Direct Energy Business Marketing, LLC d/b/a Direct Energy Business, (collectively "Seller"), each a Delaware limited liability company, and API HEAT TRANSFER INC. ("Buyer" or "Customer"), (each a "Party" and collectively, the "Parties") is entered into and effective as of January 22, 2019

1. Transactions: The terms of this CMA apply to all end-use sales of electric power ("Electricity") and/or natural gas ("Gas") as applicable (each a "Commodity" and collectively, the "Commodities"), by the applicable Seller party to Buyer (each sale a "Transaction") which will be memorialized in a writing signed by both Parties (each a "Transaction Confirmation"). Each Transaction Confirmation shall set forth the Seller party providing service to Customer for such Transaction. If a conflict arises between the terms of this CMA and a Transaction Confirmation, the Transaction Confirmation will control with respect to that particular Transaction. This CMA, any amendments to this CMA and related Transaction Confirmation(s) (together, a single integrated, "Agreement") is the entire understanding between Parties with respect to the Commodities and supersedes all other communication and prior writings with respect thereto; no oral statements are effective.
2. Performance: The Parties' obligations under this Agreement are firm. Buyer is obligated to purchase and receive, and Seller is obligated to sell and provide, the Contract Quantity of Commodity specified in a Transaction Confirmation in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Buyer will only use the Commodity at the listed Service Locations in the applicable Transaction Confirmation and will not resell the Commodity or use it at other locations without Seller's prior written consent.
3. Purchase Price: Buyer will pay the Purchase Price stated in each Transaction Confirmation. If the Purchase Price incorporates an index and the index is not announced or published on any day for any reason or if the Seller reasonably determines that a material change in the formula for or the method of determining the Purchase Price has occurred, then the Parties will use a commercially reasonable replacement price that is calculated by the Seller. If Seller concludes that a change in any Law(s) increases Seller's costs, the Purchase Price may be adjusted by Seller to reflect such costs. "Law(s)" mean all tariffs, laws, orders, rules, decisions, taxes, regulations, transmission rates, and Utility changes to Buyer's monthly capacity and/or transmission obligations.
4. Billing and Payment: Seller will invoice Buyer for the Actual Quantity of Commodity and for any other amounts incurred by Buyer under this Agreement. Payment is due within fifteen (15) days of the date of the invoice. If an invoice is issued and the Actual Quantity cannot be verified by the time, the invoice will be based on Seller's good faith estimate of the Actual Quantity. Seller will adjust Buyer's account following (i) confirmation of the Actual Quantity, (ii) any Utility discrepancy or adjustment or (iii) any other corrections or adjustments, including adjustments to, or re-calculation of, Taxes. Buyer will pay interest on late payments at $1.5 \%$ per month or, if lower, the maximum rate permitted by law ("Interest Rate"). Buyer is also responsible for all costs and fees, including reasonable attorney's fees, incurred in collecting payment. "Actual Quantity" means the actual quantity of Commodity that is either delivered or metered, as applicable, to Buyer's account. "Utility" means a state regulated entity engaged in the distribution of Gas or Electricity.
5. Taxes: Buyer is responsible for paying any Taxes associated with the Actual Quantity of Commodity sold under this Agreement that may become due at and after the Delivery Point. The Purchase Price does not include Taxes that are or may be the responsibility of the Buyer, unless such inclusion is required by Law. Buyer will reimburse Seller for any Taxes that Seller is required to collect and pay on Buyer's behalf and will indemnify, defend and hold Seller harmless from any liability against all Buyer's Taxes. Buyer will furnish Seller with any necessary documentation showing its exemption from Taxes, if applicable, and

Buyer will be liable for any Taxes assessed against Seller because of Buyer's failure to timely provide or properly complete any such documentation. "Taxes" means all applicable federal, state and local taxes, including any associated penalties and interest and any new taxes imposed in the future during the term of this Agreement. Liabilities imposed in this Section will survive the termination of this Agreement.
6. Disputes: If either Party in good faith disputes amounts owed under Sections 3, 4, 5 and 8, the disputing Party will contact the non-disputing Party promptly and pay the undisputed amount by the payment due date. The Parties will negotiate in good faith regarding such dispute for a period of not more than fifteen (15) Business Days. In the event the Parties are unable to resolve such dispute, the disputing Party will pay the balance of the original invoice and either Party may exercise any remedy available to it in law or equity pursuant to this Agreement. In the event of a dispute other than for an invoiced amount, the Parties will use their best efforts to resolve the dispute promptly. Actions taken by a Party exercising its contractual rights will not be construed as a dispute for purposes of this Section.

# 8. Buyer's Usage Obligations: 

A. Material Usage Deviation If there is a Material Usage Deviation, Buyer will be responsible for the losses and costs, including the costs of obtaining and/or liquidating the applicable volume, based upon the difference between the applicable Contract Quantity and Actual Quantity. Buyer will pay the amount of such losses and costs to Seller within fifteen (15) Business Days of Seller's invoice. "Material Usage Deviation" means any deviation in Actual Quantity at the Service Location(s) stated in the related Transaction Confirmation from Contract Quantity (or, as applicable, estimated Contract Quantities) stated in that Transaction Confirmation of $+/-25 \%$ or more, which is not caused by weather.
B. Balancing Charges: For Transactions involving the purchase and sale of Gas only, Buyer will be responsible for Balancing Charges unless Prior Notice of a material variation in usage is provided to Seller and actual usage is consistent with that Prior Notice. "Balancing Charges" means Utility fees, costs or charges and penalties assessed for failure to satisfy the Utility's balancing and/or nomination requirements. "Prior Notice" is defined as forty-eight (48) hours before the start of the Gas Day for which the material variation in usage will apply. "Gas Day" means a period of 24 consecutive hours as defined by the Utility. Buyer will make any payment due pursuant to this Section within five (5) Business Days of the date of Seller's invoice.

If Buyer fails to curtail as directed, Buyer will pay or reimburse Seller for all Balancing Charges assessed by the Utility. Payment by Buyer of any Balancing Charges will be due within five (5) Business Days of the date of Seller's invoice.
9. Force Majeure: A Party claiming Force Majeure will be excused from its obligations under Section 2 as long as it provides prompt notice of the Force Majeure and uses due diligence to remove its cause and resume performance as promptly as reasonably possible. During a Force Majeure, Buyer will not be excused from its responsibility for Balancing Charges nor from its responsibility to pay for Commodity received. "Force Majeure" means a material, unavoidable occurrence beyond a Party's control, and does not include inability to pay, an increase or decrease in Taxes or the cost of Commodity, the economic hardships of a Party, or the full or partial closure of Buyer's facilities, unless such closure itself is due to Force Majeure.
10. Financial Responsibility: Seller's entry into this Agreement and each Transaction is conditioned on Buyer, its parent, any guarantor or any successor maintaining its creditworthiness during the Delivery Period and any Renewal Term. When Seller has reasonable grounds for insecurity regarding Buyer's ability or willingness to perform all of its outstanding obligations under any agreement between the Parties, Seller may require Buyer to provide adequate assurance, which may include, in the Seller's discretion, security in the form of cash deposits, prepayments, letters of credit or other guaranty of payment or performance ("Credit Assurance").

"Bankrupt" means an entity (a) files a petition or otherwise commences, authorizes or acquiesces in the commencement of a proceeding or cause of action under any bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or similar law, or has any such petition filed or commenced against it, (b) makes an assignment or any general arrangement for the benefit of creditors, (c) otherwise becomes bankrupt or insolvent, however evidenced,(d)has a liquidator, administrator, receiver, trustee, conservator or similar official appointed with respect to it or any substantial portion of its property or assets, (e) has a secured party take possession of all or any substantial portion of its assets or (f) is dissolved or has a resolution passed for its winding-up, official management or liquidation (other than pursuant to a consolidation, amalgamation or merger.
12. Remedies: In the event of a Default, the non-defaulting Party may: (i) withhold any payments or suspend performance; (ii) upon written notice, provided that no notice is required with respect to Section 11(iii) or a breach of Section 13A(c), accelerate any or all amounts owing between the Parties and terminate any or all Transactions and/or this Agreement; (iii) calculate a settlement amount by calculating all amounts due to Seller for Actual Quantity and the Close-out Value for each Transaction being terminated; and/or (iv) net or aggregate, as appropriate, all settlement amounts and all other amounts owing between the Parties and their affiliates under this Agreement and other energy-related agreements between them and their affiliates, whether or not then due and whether or not subject to any contingencies, plus costs incurred, into one single amount ("Net Settlement Amount"). Any Net Settlement Amount due from the defaulting Party to the non-defaulting Party will be paid within three (3) Business Days of written notice from the non-defaulting Party. Interest on any unpaid portion of the Net Settlement Amount will accrue daily at the Interest Rate. "Close-out Value" is the sum of (a) the amount due to the non-defaulting Party regarding the Contract Quantities (or, as applicable, estimated Contract Quantities) remaining to be delivered as stated in the applicable Transaction Confirmation(s) during the Delivery Period or, if applicable, the current Renewal Term, calculated by determining the difference between the Purchase Price and the Market Price for such quantities; and (b) without duplication, any net losses or costs incurred by the non-defaulting Party for terminating the Transaction(s), including costs of obtaining, maintaining and/or liquidating commercially reasonable hedges, Balancing Charges and/or transaction costs. "Market Price" means the price for similar quantities of Commodity at the Delivery Point during the Delivery Period or Renewal Term, as applicable. For purposes of determining Close-out Value, (i) Market Price will be determined by the non-defaulting Party in good faith as of a date and time as close as reasonably practical to the date and time of termination or liquidation of the applicable Transaction(s), and (ii) Market Price may be ascertained through reference to quotations provided by recognized energy brokers or dealers, market indices, bona-fide offers from third-parties, or by reference to commercially reasonable forward pricing valuations. The Parties agree that the Close-out Value constitutes a reasonable approximation of damages, and is not a penalty or punitive in any respect. Seller may, but need not, physically liquidate a Transaction or enter into a replacement transaction to determine Close-out Value or Net Settlement Amount. The defaulting Party is responsible for all costs and fees incurred for collection of Net Settlement Amount, including, reasonable attorney's fees and expert witness fees.
