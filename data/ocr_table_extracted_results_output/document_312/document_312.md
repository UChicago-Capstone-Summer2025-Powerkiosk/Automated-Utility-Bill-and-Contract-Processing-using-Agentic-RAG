"The combined Public Change represents a combination of three formally known as: "Conservation and Load Management Change. Renewable Energy Investment Change, and the System Benefits Change." This change also includes the Conservation Adjustment Mechanism approved by the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority in Docket No. 13-11-14.
"Effective January 1, 2007, The Generation Services Change (GSC) and the Bepassable Federally Mandated Congestion Change (BFMCC) have been combined into the "GSC Change" listed in the Supplier Services Section of your bill. The GSC reflects all of the cost of procurring energy from Eversource wholesale suppliers. The BFMCC portion of this line item is $\$ 0.0003 / k W h$. If you multiply the BFMCC rate by the number of kWhs on your bill, you can calculate the dollar amount associated with the BFMCC. Local Delivery Improvements: Recovers company investments that protect, strengthen or modernize the electric grid. Beginning this month, you will receive a bill credit as a result of the performance penalty assessed by the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority related to Tropical Storm Isales. This credit is based on usage and varies by customer rate. For the typical customer using 700 kWh of electricity a month, the credit is about $\$ 1$ a month and will be in effect for 12 billing cycles. See 'TS Isales Performance Penalty' on page 2 of your bill.
