![](images/img-1.jpeg)

The image is a bar chart showing air emissions relative to the New York State average. The chart has three vertical bars, each representing a different pollutant:

- **Sulfur Dioxide (SO2)**: 103%
- **Nitrogen Oxide (NOx)**: 103%
- **Carbon Dioxide (CO2)**: 103%

The y-axis is labeled with percentages, ranging from 0 to 200, with a notable mark at 100. Each bar reaches the 103% mark, indicating emissions slightly above the state average. The background is light blue, and the bars are black.

Note: Sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides are key pollutants that contribute to acid rain and smog, and carbon dioxide, contributes to global climate change. Depending on fuel source, size, and location, the generation of electricity may also result in other public health, environmental and socio-economic impacts not disclosed above.

## Estimating Your Usage

When we are unable to obtain a reading, we estimate your usage based on your past usage, taking current weather conditions into account. Because our meters keep a continuous record of usage, any difference between estimated and actual usage is reconciled with the next meter reading. To avoid estimated readings, you can take your own reading on or just before the scheduled date shown on your bill and call it in at 1-888-932-0301.
