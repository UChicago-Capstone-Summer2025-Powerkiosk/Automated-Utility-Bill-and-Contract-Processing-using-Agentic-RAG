- MYLAR BALLOONS \& POWER LINES DON'T MIXI Every year, thousands of residents across northern Illinois are affected by power outages caused by foil balloons. If a foil or Mylar balloon touches a power line, it can cause power surges or service interruptions. Keep balloons tied securely while outside! If you see a balloon, or any object, caught in a power line, do not attempt to retrieve it. Call ComEd at 1-800-EDISON-1.
