Power delivery: Includes specific labor associated with transmission and distribution facilities, metering, billing, customer service, allocated overheads, taxes and a profit component.
Power supply: Costs include all purchased power and energy source costs. For generation plants owned by Xcel Energy, power supply costs also include labor at generation plants, depreciation of generation plants, allocated overhead, taxes and a profit component.
Price components: Percentage components for an average monthly electric bill:
![](images/img-5.jpeg)

The image is a graph/chart, specifically a pair of donut charts. 

- The left chart is labeled "Residential service" and shows:
  - "Power delivery" at 37%
  - "Power supply" at 63%

- The right chart is labeled "Commercial service" and shows:
  - "Power delivery" at 40%
  - "Power supply" at 60%

The charts visually represent the percentage breakdown of power delivery and power supply for residential and commercial services. The "Power delivery" section is highlighted in blue, while "Power supply" is in gray. The text "Transmission and delivery" and "Generation and purchase" are associated with "Power delivery" and "Power supply," respectively.

Example: If your residential bill for this month is $\$ 67.10$, then about $63 \%$ (or $\$ 42.34$ of your bill) is for the electricity itself, and about $37 \%$ (or $\$ 24.76$ ) covers the cost of having the electricity delivered to your home.
Note: Price component information applies to the average customer and may differ when applied to individual customers. Additional information is available upon request.

Power supply mix: Our Colorado energy mix includes coal, natural gas, wind, solar and hydroelectric power. Energy sources used in power generation and purchase for all energy customers in the 2019 calendar year:
