# STATEMENT OF CUSTOMER'S RIGHTS 

If you have any billing or service questions, you should first call PSE\&G at 1-800-436-7734 between 7am and 8pm, Monday through Friday, or between 7am and 5pm on Saturdays or visit one of our customer service centers. You may have counsel or third party representation when appearing before PSE\&G to contest a bona fide disputed charge.

If you are not able to make a payment, we may be able to help you by setting up a reasonable payment arrangement. You can discuss your options by visiting one of our customer service centers, or by calling our credit and collection center at 1-800-357-2262 between 7:30am and 8pm, Monday through Friday.

If you are not able to resolve a dispute with us, you may contact the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities to ask them to help you resolve it. PSE\&G operates under the authority of the Board.

The Board's address is:
44 South Clinton Avenue,
Trenton, NJ 08625
Phone: 1609 341-9188,
Toll free 1800 624-0241.

You may also ask for a formal hearing with the Board to discuss your dispute.

If you contact the Board within five days of trying to resolve your dispute with us, we will not shut off service to you because you haven't paid your bill. However, you must pay all other charges that you're not disputing.

## If your service is shut off

If we shut off your service because you fail to pay outstanding charges, we will charge a reconnection fee of $\$ 45.00$ for each service when you do pay the amount you owe. We may not be able to restore your service on the date you make your payment. We may also require you to pay a security deposit.

You can avoid paying a security deposit and earning a poor credit rating with PSE\&G by paying your bills by their due date. A fee of $\$ 30.00$ will be charged if a visit is made to collect past due bills. A late payment fee may be charged for past due bills.
