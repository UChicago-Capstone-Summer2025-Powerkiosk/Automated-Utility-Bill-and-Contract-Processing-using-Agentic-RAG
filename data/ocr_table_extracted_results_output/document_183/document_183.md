## EXHIBIT C PERCENT-FIXED AND INDEX

This Percent Fixed and Index Product allows Customer and Reliant to agree to fixed Shaped Block Prices for up to four Shaped Blocks per Month. Each Shaped Block will represent a defined percentage of Customer's Actual Consumption. The remaining portion of Customer's Actual Consumption will be charged at the Real Time Index Rate. Customer must have an aggregated peak electricity demand of at least 1 MW.

## RELIANT INVOICE

Reliant will invoice each of Customer's Locations on a monthly basis. Invoices may consist of the following components:

1. Shaped Block Charges;
2. Real Time Index Charges;
3. Adder Charge;
4. Discretionary Service Fees (if any);
5. Competition Charges (whether positive or negative);
6. Transmission and Distribution Charges (if applicable);
7. Any applicable Taxes;
8. Nodal Congestion Charges (if any);
9. RUC Charges (if any); and
10. Any additional charges that are expressly authorized in this Agreement.

The Shaped Block Charges and the Real Time Index Charges do not include, and the Reliant Invoice may also set forth the following components: (a) Adder Charge, Discretionary Service Fees, Competition Charges, Nodal Congestion Charges, RUC Charges and other authorized charges and (b) any additional costs or charges imposed on or associated with the delivery of the Actual Consumption to the extent that such additional costs or charges would not have been incurred but for Customer's breach of this Agreement.

## MATERIAL CHANGE

(a) A Material Change occurs if for any two consecutive billing periods Customer's Actual Consumption for each billing period is less than $75 \%$ of the Benchmark Quantity or is more than $125 \%$ of the Benchmark Quantity. If a Material Change occurs then Reliant may at any time notify Customer in writing (the "Notification Letter") of adjusted Benchmark Quantities and one or more adjusted Shaped Block Prices that reflect the incremental effect the difference between the unadjusted and the adjusted Benchmark Quantities has on the Actual Consumption included in the Shaped Blocks. These adjustments will be effective as of the next Meter Read Date.
(b) If Customer anticipates any change in operations at any Customer Location(s), including Customer's plans for new construction, facility replacement or equipment modification, planned closures, applications for new construction permits, or new environmental limits that is likely to cause a Material Change, then Customer must notify Reliant promptly, but no later than 60 days before that anticipated change in operations (a "Notice of Material Change"). If Reliant receives a Notice of Material Change:
(i) Reliant may at any time, notify Customer in writing (the "Notification Letter") of adjusted Benchmark Quantities and one or more adjusted Shaped Block Prices that reflect the incremental effect the difference between the unadjusted and the adjusted Benchmark Quantities has on the Actual Consumption included in the Shaped Blocks.
(ii) Customer may accept the adjusted quantity and price by signing the Notification Letter and returning it to Reliant within 5 Business Days of the Notification Letter date. Once accepted, the adjusted Benchmark Quantities and adjusted Shaped Block Price will be effective on the first Meter Read Date after the expiration of that 5 Business Day notice period. If Customer does not sign and return the Notification Letter within the 5 Business Day notice period, then the Benchmark Quantities and Shaped Block Price will not be adjusted, and Reliant may terminate the Energy Transaction and Energy Transaction Confirmation as of a specified termination date upon at least 5 Business Days' Notice to Customer.

ERCOT for the Hub(s). If the Day Ahead Settlement Point Price(s) are not published by ERCOT or are otherwise unavailable, then for the period(s) for which Day Ahead Settlement Point Price(s) are not available, Nodal Congestion will be based on difference(s) between the Real Time Settlement Point Price(s) determined by ERCOT for the Load Zones associated with the Customer Location(s) and the Hub(s).
"Nodal Congestion Charges" means (a) for the Shaped Blocks, the amount determined by calculating the product of "Nodal Congestion" and the percent of "Actual Consumption" subject to Shaped Blocks and (b) for the Real Time Index Portion, the amount determined by calculating the product of "Nodal Congestion" and the Real Time Index Portion.
"Power Factor" means the ratio of kW to kilovolt amperes expressed as a percentage, calculated by dividing kW by kilovolt amperes.
"Real Time Index Charge" means for each fifteen minute ERCOT settlement interval for the Load Zone in which the Customer Location(s) are located, the Real Time Index Portion multiplied by LMPZ.
"Real Time Index Portion" means for each Time Period and Month, the amount determined by subtracting the Actual Consumption attributable to the cumulative Shaped Block Percentages as set forth on Exhibit D from Customer's Actual Consumption.
"Real Time Index Rate" means for each fifteen minute ERCOT settlement interval for the Load Zone in which the Customer Location(s) are located, the LMPZ.
"RUC Charges" includes "Directly Assigned RUC Charge" or "Capacity Shortfall RUC Charge" and means the amount calculated by multiplying Customer's proportionate share of the RUC Capacity Shortfall by the total ERCOT Reliability Unit Commitment Make-Whole Amount. This Charge applies to that portion of Customer's Actual Consumption priced at Real-Time Settlement Point Prices.
"Shaped Block" means a defined percentage of Customer's Actual Consumption for a Time Period in a Month. There can be no more than four Shaped Blocks in a Month.
"Shaped Block Charge" means for each Shaped Block during each Time Period of the Month the amount determined by calculating the Shaped Block Price multiplied by the Shaped Block Percentage multiplied by the Actual Consumption.
"Shaped Block Percentage" means for each Shaped Block the percentage of Actual Consumption for which Customer and Reliant have agreed to a given Shaped Block Price as set forth in Exhibit D. The Shaped Block Percentage must be greater than or equal to $20 \%$ of Customer's Actual Consumption in a Time Period unless the percentage represents the amount necessary so that the final Shaped Block for the Month results in the sum of all Shaped Block Percentages being $100 \%$ of Customer's Actual Consumption. The sum of the Shaped Block Percentages cannot exceed $100 \%$ during any Month or Time Period.
"Shaped Block Price" means the fixed price for Energy agreed upon by the Parties for each MWh consumed at the Customer Location(s) and associated with each Shaped Block Percentage for a specific Time Period as set forth in Exhibit D.
"Time Period" means the specific hours of a week defined as follows:
(a) On-Peak = Monday through Friday excluding NERC holidays, 16 hour period for hours ending 0700 through 2200 CPT,
(b) Off-Peak = Saturday and Sunday and NERC holidays, 16 hour period for hours ending 0700 through 2200 CPT and Monday through Sunday, for all hours 0100 through 0600 and 2300 through 2400 CPT.
(c) All-Hour = Monday through Sunday, for all hours 0100 through 2400 CPT.
"Transmission and Distribution Charges" means, for each Customer Location, all transmission and distribution charges and other cost recovery charges and fees outlined in the TDSP's tariff and billed to Reliant for the TDSP's services to deliver Energy to the applicable Customer Location; provided, such charges and fees will not include any Competition Charges.

(iii) If Reliant terminates the Energy Transaction and Energy Transaction Confirmation, Reliant will calculate a Termination payment by determining Reliant's Losses and Gains. If Reliant realizes a Gain, Reliant will pay Customer the amount of the Gain. If Reliant realizes a Loss, Customer will pay Reliant the amount of the Loss. If all Customer Locations are not switched to a new Energy supplier effective upon the termination date specified in the Notice to Customer, then Reliant will have the rights specified in the Term provision of the Agreement.

Any election by Reliant not to exercise its rights under this Section will not preclude Reliant's exercise of those rights at a later date.

SHAPED BLOCK TRANSACTION PROCEDURES. If Customer and Reliant have agreed to fewer than four Shaped Blocks for a Month then Customer may request additional Shaped Blocks and associated Shaped Block Prices for that Month as provided under this Exhibit. The request must be submitted no later than noon, Central Prevailing Time on the second Business Day before the beginning of the Month for which the request is made or other deadline that the Parties may agree to. Reliant's Designated Representative will respond to Customer's request with a proposed Shaped Block Price, within a commercially reasonable period considering the then-existing market activity. The Parties understand that there are no obligations or rights created in favor of any Party with respect to any Shaped Blocks or Shaped Block Prices until an amendment is signed by both Parties.

# ADDITIONAL CAPITALIZED TERMS NOT DEFINED IN EXHIBIT A

# CUSTOMER'S ACKNOWLEDGMENT 

Customer acknowledges that Reliant and its affiliates are in the business of buying and selling power in the ERCOT Balancing Energy Services market for each of their own accounts and that participation in that market may affect the calculation of the LMPZ. Customer will pay the amounts due under this Agreement that are based upon the LMPZ as promulgated by ERCOT. Subject to the right of Customer to dispute a Reliant Invoice, Customer will not withhold payment for any reason, including, investigatory activities undertaken by ERCOT or PUCT. Nothing in this Agreement restricts Reliant or any of Reliant's affiliates from participating in the ERCOT Balancing Energy Services market.
