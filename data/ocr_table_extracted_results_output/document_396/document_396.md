# RETAIL ENERGY SERVICE AGREEMENT 

This Retail Energy Electricity Service Agreement, including the Offer Sheet which is incorporated herein (this "Agreement") is entered into between Hudson Energy Services, LLC, a New Jersey limited liability company ("HES"), and 400-410 MI REAL ESTATE HOLDING, LLC ("Customer"). HES and Customer may hereinafter be referred to individually as a "Party" or collectively as the "Parties".

## SECTION 1: Scope and Term

Customer appoints HES as its Alternative Retail Electric Supplier (ARES) for the Utility Account numbers ("Accounts") identified on the Offer Sheet. Specifically, Customer authorizes HES to act as Customer's exclusive agent for all matters related to service under Utility's open access program. HES shall provide all the services required of an ARES including, without limitation, procuring, scheduling and causing to be delivered electricity to each Account during the Term. This Agreement shall commence as of the Effective Date, as identified on the Offer Sheet and, unless terminated earlier in accordance with the provisions of the Agreement, shall continue until the end of the Term. At HES discretion and upon notice to Customer, this Agreement shall become null and void, unenforceable, and cancelled without penalty as to any Account(s) identified on the Offer Sheet, that are not eligible to take delivery service for thirty (30) days or more from Start Date. Should the Term expire and the Account(s) remain on service with HES for any reason, HES may continue to serve the Account(s) on a month to month basis in accordance with this Agreement at the Expired Term Price.

## SECTION 2: Retail Energy Charges

2.1 Energy Price. The Energy Price for Actual Usage is specified on the Offer Sheet. The Energy Price includes the cost of energy, transmission service charges, capacity charges, ancillary service and ISO charges, renewable portfolio standard costs, and distribution and transmission losses.
2.2 Customer Charge. The Customer Charge is specified on the Offer Sheet.
2.3 Delivery Charges. Delivery Charges will be billed separately by the Utility and are not included in this Agreement.
2.4 Taxes. If Customer is exempt from any payment of any Taxes, Customer will provide HES with all required exemption certificates. Unless otherwise communicated to HES from Customer, HES shall not recognize any exemption and will not refund or credit previously paid Taxes, unless the taxing entity sends the refund to HES.
2.5 Price Redetermination. Either HES or Customer may reasonably request to renegotiate the Energy Price set forth in the Offer Sheet subject to mutually agreeable extension of the Term. This section shall not be construed as an obligation of either Party to modify the Energy Price or Term, and any such modifications of the Energy Price or Term shall only become effective if evidenced in written instrument and executed by both Parties.

## SECTION 3: Billing and Payment

3.1 Billing and Payment. HES will invoice Customer on a regular basis. Customer will remit payment, within the Payment Terms as specified on the Offer Sheet. The invoice will be based on the actual data provided by the Utility and the ISO. If the Utility or the ISO do not provide actual data in a timely manner, HES may use estimated data to calculate Customer's invoice and, upon receipt of actual data, will reconcile the charges and adjust them as needed in subsequent invoices. Customer is permitted to make payments using a credit card provided Customer's annual electricity consumption, at the time of entering into this agreement, is less than 5,000,000 kWh. Customer's ability to pay by credit card may be reviewed by HES throughout the duration of this Agreement and may be rescinded in HES' sole discretion.
3.2 Late Penalties. If Customer fails to remit all invoiced amounts, other than amount disputed in accordance with this section, after the due date, interest will accrue on any due and unpaid amounts from the date the monies were owed at a rate of one and one-half percent ( $1.5 \%$ ) per month, or the highest rate permitted by law, whichever is less. A fee of $\$ 25$ will be assessed to Customer for each returned payment for insufficient funds.
3.3 Invoice Disputes. If Customer in good faith disputes some portion of
an invoice, it will provide HES written notice by the invoice due date. In all cases, Parties will use good faith efforts to resolve any dispute.

## SECTION 4: Credit

Customer may be required to provide an initial deposit as specified on the Offer Sheet, and/or additional deposit during the Term if: (a) Customer is determined to have experienced a material decline in creditworthiness; or (b) Customer has been delinquent in paying any electric bill two or more times during the past 12 twelve months. Any such deposit will be held without interest. The deposit, less any outstanding balance owed by Customer to HES, will be credited to Customer upon closing Customer's account with HES. In lieu of a cash deposit, HES may, in its sole discretion, accept other forms of security from Customer that HES finds acceptable.

## SECTION 5: Early Termination

5.1 Termination for Material Change. If a Material Change occurs (unless Customer has fully cured the condition within thirty (30) calendar days, if such cure is within Customer's ability), HES may terminate this Agreement as to the affected Accounts upon fifteen (15) days prior written notice to Customer without penalty for early termination; if the Material Change is due to any of the causes described in clause (b) of the definition of Material Change, Customer shall be obligated to pay HES the Early Termination Charge within 20 days following a written demand by HES.

### 5.2 Early Termination Charge.

(a) If this Agreement is terminated by HES as to any Account due to a Customer Event of Default, Customer shall be obligated to pay HES the Early Termination Charge within 20 days following a written demand from HES.
(b) If, by mutual agreement of Customer and HES, retail electric service under the Agreement is cancelled as to one or more Accounts due to operational reasons applicable to the facility(ies) served by such Account but this Agreement continues in effect as to the remaining Accounts, in lieu of Customer being required to pay the Early Termination Charge for such cancelled Accounts, Parties may attempt to agree on remedies as provided for by Section 10.4.
