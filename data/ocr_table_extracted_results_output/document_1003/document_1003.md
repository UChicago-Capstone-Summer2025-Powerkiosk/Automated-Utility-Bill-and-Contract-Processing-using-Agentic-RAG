Meter Reading Information - PGW uses its best effort to obtain an actual meter reading regularly, and at least every six months for customers without automatic meter reading devices. When the meter is not read, PGW estimates your gas use. To avoid estimates, you may read your own meter and call us with the reading. We also offer stamped, preaddressed postcards, which you can use to send us your meter reading by the specified date. To request a supply of these cards, call (215) 235-1000, or write us at P.O.

Distribution Charges - The charge for delivery of natural gas from the point of receipt by the NGDC to the customer.

Distribution System Improvement Charge (DSIC) - A charge approved by the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (PUC) for recovery of the reasonable and prudent costs incurred to repair, improve, or replace eligible distribution property.
