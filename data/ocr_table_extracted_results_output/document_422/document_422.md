The Company is the owner, manager or rental agent for the Facilities. Green Mountain is a certified retail electric provider which supplies retail electric service to multi-family housing properties and individual units in the Market Area (hereinafter defined).

## AGREEMENT:

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises and undertakings set forth in this Agreement, the parties hereby agree as follows:

## ARTICLE 1 <br> SALES REFERRAL SERVICES

1.1 Services to be Performed by the Company. The Company agrees to conduct a Referral Program in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, whereby Company will refer Residential Customers (as defined in Section 1.3 (b) below) exclusively to Green Mountain as the preferred retail electric provider of Services to the Company's Residential Customers who reside in the multi-family housing properties located within the Market Area and shown on Exhibit A, attached hereto, as it may be amended from time-to-time. As used in this Agreement, the term "Market Area" shall mean the areas of the State of Texas that are open to competition for the retail supply of retail electric services to Residential Customers. The Company will refer Residential Customers to Green Mountain's Services and encourage enrollment through Green Mountain's resident call center as provided in Section 1.2(e) below. The Company may also refer Residential Customers to Green Mountain's Services and encourage enrollment through the Company's Internet-based resident connection service, currently the Internet website operated by WhiteFence; however, the Company is free to use another resident connection service or no such service at all if reasonably acceptable to Green Mountain (such service being referred to herein as the "IRCS").

### 1.2 Company Obligations in the Referral Program.

(a) During the term of this Agreement, the Company will not, at any of the Facilities, display marketing materials or promote the services of other retail electric providers; however, Company shall have no obligation or liability to Green Mountain if Company's residents fail or refuse to purchase electric energy or services from Green Mountain.
(b) The Company shall not engage in any other marketing or promotional activities for any of Green Mountain's products or services, other than Green Mountain's retail electric service, without Green Mountain's prior written consent.
(c) The Company shall use only those scripts provided and approved by Green Mountain in writing prior to use by representatives at the Facilities. The Company will make reasonable best efforts to ensure that its representatives distribute to all Residential Customers Green Mountain's applicable Terms of Service Contract and display, if space is available, approved Green Mountain marketing materials. The Company shall not make any representations or warranties concerning Green Mountain or its electric services that are not included in the applicable Terms of Service Contract or any marketing materials provided by, or approved in writing by, Green Mountain. Further, the Company shall not make any materially false or misleading statements about Green Mountain, its services or its competitors.
(d) Neither party shall disclose to any third party the terms of this Agreement or information about sales by the Company (or lack thereof) under this Agreement; provided, however, that such party may disclose such information in

an action arising out of this Agreement or pursuant to applicable law or regulation (including without limitation disclosures required by the Securities and Exchange Commission, Company's auditors or Company's counsel), an order issued by the PUC (defined below) or a court of competent jurisdiction. In addition, Company may disclose such information to prospective buyer(s) of one or more of Company's properties; provided the Company first notifies Green Mountain of such disclosure, and the prospective buyer(s) enters into a confidentiality agreement with the Company covering such information.
(e) During the term hereof, there shall be no more than three (3) PUC Complaints in any calendar month, nor more than one (1) PUC Complaint in each of three (3) consecutive calendar months. A "PUC Complaint", for purposes of this Agreement, shall be any formal or informal complaint lodged with the Public Utilities Commission of Texas ("PUC") against Green Mountain, irrespective of how the communication is made to the PUC, as a result of an action or omission by the Company in connection with its services in the Green Mountain sales referral program. Without limiting any and all rights Green Mountain has hereunder, if PUC Complaints exceed either of the foregoing limitations, the referral program portion of this Agreement may be suspended immediately by Green Mountain in its sole discretion.

# 1.3 Compensation to the Company. 

(a) Green Mountain shall pay the Company a $\$ 100$ fee for each Validated Acquisition. Such fee shall be paid in accordance with the terms of this Section 1.3.
(b) Additional Payment-Related Terms. For purposes of this Agreement, the following terms shall have the meanings set forth below:
(i) "Acquired Customer" shall mean a Residential Customer residing in any of the Company's Facilities with approved credit or who has paid Green Mountain a deposit that has been properly enrolled to receive electric service from Green Mountain.
(ii) "Residential Customer" shall mean a person whose electric distribution company rate code is in the residential rate class.
(iii) "Validated Acquisition" shall mean the enrollment of an Acquired Customer for electric service from Green Mountain, where: (A) the enrollment for such services has occurred through the Company or Acquired Customer having faxed to Green Mountain a completed, pre-printed Electrical Service Election Form containing the identification number assigned to the Company by Green Mountain, and/or such other forms or information required by Green Mountain (the "Enrollment Form") and (B) such enrollment and information is verified by Green Mountain's designated business system for entry of customer enrollment information (the "GM Customer Data System").
(c) No Fee for Rescinded Sales. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained herein, the Company shall not be entitled to any compensation whatsoever for any Rescinded Sale (as defined below). Green Mountain shall implement this provision by calculating the number of Rescinded Sales in each calendar month and multiplying that number by the fees attributable to such Validated Acquisitions. Green Mountain shall then set-off the calculated amount from any future amounts owed to the Company. For purposes of this Agreement, a "Rescinded Sale" shall mean a Validated Acquisition (meaning that confirmation is received from the GM Customer Data System) where the Acquired Customer cancels Green Mountain's Services prior to activation by the applicable TDSP.
