# Terms and Conditions - Effective Date: 03/29/2017 

These Terms and Conditions ("Ts\&Cs") apply to any Commodity Supply Agreement ("CSA") entered into by Buyer and Seller which references these Ts\&Cs. Buyer and Seller may hereinafter be referred to individually as "Party" or collectively as "Parties". Capitalized terms have the meaning ascribed to them in these Ts\&Cs, applicable CSAs or as defined by any ISO, TDU or State law.

1. Definitions:
a. "Account" means the device used by any TDU to measure and settle Buyer's demand and/or usage.
b. "Interest" means $1.5 \%$ per month.
c. "ISO" means Independent System Operator; for example the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, the New York ISO, PennsylvaniaNew Jersey-Maryland Interconnection, New England ISO, Mid-West ISO and California ISO.
d. "TDU" means transmission and distribution company, transmission and distribution service provider, electric distribution company, electric distribution utility, local distribution company, or any other entity responsible for the transportation or delivery of any commodity hereunder.
2. Agreement: Seller shall sell and Buyer shall purchase the commodity pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.
3. Payment Terms: If Buyer is in a market where the TDU provides a consolidated bill, then Buyer will be billed by the TDU for the TDU's fees and Seller's charges pursuant to the terms of the TDU. If Seller bills Buyer for Seller's charges either with or without the TDU's fees, Buyer will make payment within standard of the of the of the of the invoice date. Late payments will incur a one-time late payment charge of five percent (5\%) of the unpaid balance due (late payment charge and unpaid balance, together, "Unpaid Balance"). The Unpaid Balance will accrue Interest until paid, or the highest rate allowed by law, whichever is less. Additionally, a charge of $\$ 25.00$ will be accessed for each returned check or rejected ACH. Further Seller shall be entitled to attorney fees in the event legal action is necessary to collect any payment due. If there is a good faith dispute regarding any commodity charge (i.e., not any TDU charges or Taxes), Buyer will pay the undisputed amount and provide Seller with documentation to support the amount disputed. The Parties will attempt to expeditiously resolve the dispute and upon determination of the correct amount, such amount owed, if any, shall be paid within two (2) business days of resolution of the dispute. Thereafter such amount will be treated as a late payment. Seller may use estimated usage if actual metered usage is not timely received from the TDU. In such case, applicable adjustments will occur on the next invoices after receipt of actual usage. In the event Buyer disputes TDU charges or Taxes, Buyer agrees to seek its remedy directly from the entity assessing such charges.
4. Haldover: Should the term of any CSA expire without renewal then Seller may continue to supply the commodity at the Fully Variable Rate ("FVR") or apply any State, ISO or TDU rule applicable to contract expiration (e.g. Buyer switches to TDU). FVR means Seller's actual cost and fees necessary to serve Buyer's Accounts (based on the most readily available data at the time of invoicing) plus an administrative fee of $\$ 0.010 / \mathrm{kWh}$ for electricity or $\$ 1.00 / \mathrm{mmBtu}$ for natural gas.
5. Creditworthiness: Seller may request Buyer to provide financial information necessary for Seller to assess Buyer's financial condition. If at any time during the Term of this Agreement Seller determines in its reasonable discretion that Buyer is not creditworthy, Seller may require Buyer to provide collateral to support Buyer's obligations under this Agreement ("Performance Assurance"). If Buyer fails to provide Performance Assurance within two (2) business days of receipt of request for same, an Event of Default shall be deemed to have occurred and Seller shall be entitled to any and all remedies set forth in this Agreement, at law and equity.
6. Events of Default, Early Termination and Remedies: The occurrence of any of the following shall be deemed an "Event of Default" under this Agreement: a) the failure of Buyer to make payment when due if such failure is not cured within two (2) business days of notice; (b) the failure of Buyer to provide Performance Assurance as obligated herein; (c) the failure of either Party to perform any other obligation hereunder which is not excused by Force Majeure or cured within ten (10) business days of written notice of same; (d) a Party becomes bankrupt or insolvent; or (e) any TDU disconnects service to one or more of Buyer's Accounts as a result of Buyer's non-performance. If either Party terminates this Agreement (or supply service to any Account) early ("Early Termination"), the terminating Party shall give the non-terminating Party thirty (30) days advance written notice or as much notice as is reasonably possible if the termination of supply or service will occur sooner. Upon Default or Early Termination, the non-defaulting/non-terminating Party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement (or supply service to any such Account) and collect as liquidated damages, not a penalty, any "positive value of this Agreement". The "positive value of this Agreement" will be calculated as follows: (i) if Buyer is the defaulting/early terminating Party, the difference between the Commodity Rate minus the Current Market Rate multiplied by the remaining usage; or (ii) if Seller is the defaulting/early terminating Party, the difference between the Current Market Rate minus the Commodity Rate multiplied by the remaining usage. In either case, only if the resultant number is positive, will liquidated damages be owed. For purposes of this section, in the case where Buyer defaults/terminates early, Current Market Rate means the rate at which Seller could reasonably sell a like agreement (e.g., remaining volumes, product, etc.) to another like buyer and, in the case where Seller defaults/terminates early, Current Market
