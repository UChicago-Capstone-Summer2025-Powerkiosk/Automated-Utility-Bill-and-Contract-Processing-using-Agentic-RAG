## News For You

A new discount for electric bills is available if you have a financial hardship status on your electric account. Based on your household income or receipt of a public assistance benefit, you may be eligible for a $10 \%$ or $50 \%$ discount off your electric bill per month. For example, if you have a $\$ 100$ monthly bill, it would be $\$ 10$ less if you receive a $10 \%$ discount or $\$ 50$ less if you receive the $50 \%$ discount. See how to enroll at eversource.com/billhelp.
