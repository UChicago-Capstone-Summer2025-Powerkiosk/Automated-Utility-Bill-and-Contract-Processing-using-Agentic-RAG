## General Terms and Conditions

1. Agreement to Sell and Purchase Energy. This is an agreement between Plymouth Rock Energy, LLC ("Plymouth") and the undersigned customer ("Customer") under which Customer shall initiate natural gas service and begin enrollment with Plymouth (the "Agreement"). Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Plymouth agrees to sell and facilitate delivery, and Customer agrees to purchase and accept the quantity of natural gas, as estimated by Plymouth, necessary to meet Customer's requirements based upon consumption data obtained by Plymouth or the delivery schedule of the Local Distribution Utility (the "LDU"). The amount of natural gas delivered under this Agreement is subject to change based upon data reflecting Customer's consumption obtained by Plymouth or the LDU's delivery schedule. The LDU will continue to deliver the natural gas supplied by Plymouth.
2. Term. This Agreement shall commence as of the date Customer's notice regarding the change of Customer's provider to Plymouth is deemed effective by the LDU, and shall continue for 12 months beginning 6/1/2018 or the first available meter read thereafter, (the "Initial Term"). Upon completion of the Initial Term, this Agreement will automatically renew on a month-to-month basis at a variable monthly rate, unless Plymouth sends Customer written notice of proposed changes to such terms in advance of the renewal date (the "Renewal Term"). Any such written notice will be sent at least 45 days and no more than 90 days prior to the renewal date,
apprising customer of any proposed changes in the terms and conditions of this Agreement and of the Customer's right to renew, terminate or renegotiate this Agreement. While receiving service on a month-to-month basis, Customer or Plymouth may cancel or terminate this Agreement so long 30 days' advance written notice of termination is provided to the other party.

Contract rates and service start will be in line with the utility account's associated switching rules and meter read cycles.
3. Pricing, Billing, and Termination. Unless otherwise agreed to in writing, the price for all natural gas sold under this Agreement as specified above, shall be a fixed price per therm/CCF as agreed to above, plus all applicable taxes. Price includes line loss.

Plymouth will invoice Customer monthly for natural gas delivered under this Agreement, as measured by the LDU, and Customer will pay each invoice in full within 15 days of the invoice date or be subject to a late payment charge of $1.5 \%$ per month. Customer may receive a single bill for both commodity and delivery costs from either Plymouth or the LDU, or each of the LDU and Plymouth may invoice Customer separately. Customer payments remitted in response to a consolidated bill shall be pro-rated (when so required) in accordance with procedures adopted by the New York State Department of Public Service (the "DPS"). Plymouth may assign and sell Customer accounts

receivable to LDU. Failure to make full payment of Plymouth charges due on any consolidated bill prepared by the LDU for Plymouth will be grounds for disconnection of utility services and commodity service in accordance with NYPSC rules and regulations on the termination of service to non-residential customers, 16 NYCRR Section 13.3. A $\$ 30$ fee will be charged for all returned payments.

Usage Allowance: In the event that usage in any month exceeds the level of usage in the same month in the previous year ("Base Load") by 25 percent or more, the Customer may be charged a variable price for all usage in excess of the Base Load and the fixed price for usage up to the Base Load. If the usage in any month falls by 25 percent or more below the Base Load, the Customer will be charged the fixed price for all usage and shall be charged for hedging, cash out costs and/or balancing costs. Base Load usage is shown in Schedule B for reference.

Early Termination: If there is a material adverse change in the business or financial condition of Customer (as determined by Plymouth at its discretion), or if Customer fails to pay each invoice in full within 20 days of the invoice date, or if Customer fails to meet its obligations under this Agreement or pay or post any required security deposit, then, in addition to any other remedies that it may have, Plymouth may terminate this Agreement upon 15 days' written notice to Customer. If Customer terminates this Agreement prior to the end of the Initial or Renewal Term or If Plymouth terminates this Agreement due to Customer's breach, and the Agreement is for fixed price service, the Customer shall pay Plymouth, in addition to any other applicable charges, a cancellation fee equivalent to the multiplication of the (i) difference between the fixed price set forth in this Agreement and the calculation by Plymouth of the fixed price at the date of termination; and (ii)the difference between the Customer's annual usage for the 12 month period from the date of termination and the level of usage during the current Term or Renewal Term under this Agreement.
4. Assignment. Customer may not assign its interests in and delegate its obligations under this Agreement without the express written consent of Plymouth. Plymouth may sell, transfer, pledge, or assign the accounts receivable, revenues, or proceeds hereof, in connection with any financing agreement, purchase of accounts receivables program or billing services agreement, and may assign this Agreement to another energy supplier, energy services company or other entity as authorized by the DPS.
5. Information Release Authorization.

THIS INFORMATION MAY BE USED BY PLYMOUTH TO DETERMINE WHETHER IT WILL COMMENCE AND/OR CONTINUE TO PROVIDE ENERGY SUPPLY SERVICE TO CUSTOMER AND WILL NOT BE DISLLOSED TO A THIRD PARTY UNLESS REGUIRED BY LAW.

Customer agrees to provide all documentation and information reasonably requested by Plymouth in order to permit Plymouth to determine the applicable rate at which to tax Customer with respect to services provided under this Agreement.
