"Effective January 1, 2007, The Generation Services Change (GSC) and the Bypassable Federally Mandated Congestion Change (BFMCC) have been combined into the "GSC Change" listed in the Supplier Services Section of your bill. The GSC reflects all of the cost of procurning energy from Everaource wholesale suppliers. The BFMCC portion of this line item is $\$ 0.0003 / \mathrm{kWh}$. If you multiply the BFMCC rate by the number of kWhs on your bill, you can calculate the dollar amount associated with the BFMCC. Local Delivery Improvements: Receivers company investments that protect, strengthen or modernize the electric grid. Beginning this month, you will receive a bill credit as a result of the performance penalty assessed by the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority related to Tropical Storm Isaias.
