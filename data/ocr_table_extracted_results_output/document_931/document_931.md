## Important definitions

Rotating outage blocks are subject to change without advance notice due to operational conditions.
Tier 1/Baseline allowance: Some residential rates are given a Tier 1/Baseline allowance - a CPUC approved percentage of average customer usage during summer and winter months. Your Tier 1/Baseline allowance provides for basic needs at an affordable price and encourages conservation. Your allowance is assigned based on the climate where you live, the season and your heat source. As you use more energy, you pay more for usage. Any usage over your baseline allowance will be charged at a higher price.
High Usage: An increased price per kWh whenever electricity usage exceeds four times the Baseline Allowance (Tier 1) in a billing period. This charge does not apply to Time-of-Use rate plans.

Wildfire Fund Charge: Charge on behalf of the State of California Department of Water Resources (DWR) to fund the California Wildfire Fund. For usage prior to October 1, 2020, this charge included costs related to the 2001 California energy crisis, also collected on behalf of the DWR. These charges belong to DWR, not PG\&E.
Power Charge Indifference Adjustment (PCIA): The PCIA is a charge to ensure that both PG\&E customers and those who have left PG\&E service to purchase electricity from other providers pay for the above market costs for electric generation resources that were procured by PG\&E on their behalf. 'Above market' refers to the difference between what the utility pays for electric generation and current market prices for the sale of those resources. Visit www.pge.com/cca.
Wildfire Hardening Charge: PG\&E has been permitted to issue bonds that enable it to recover more quickly certain costs related to preventing and mitigating catastrophic wildfires, while reducing the total cost to its customers. Your bill for electric service includes a fixed recovery charge called the Wildfire Hardening Charge that has been approved by the CPUC to repay those bonds. The right to recover the Wildfire Hardening Charge has been transferred to a separate entity (called the Special Purpose Entity) that issued the bonds and does not belong to PG\&E. PG\&E is collecting the Wildfire Hardening Charge on behalf of the Special Purpose Entity. For details visit: www.pge.com/tariffs/assets/pdf/tariffbook/ELEC_PRELIM_JF.pdf.
Recovery Bond Charge/Gredit: Your bill for electric service includes a charge that has been approved by the CPUC to repay bonds issued for certain costs related to catastrophic wildfires. Separately, a PG\&E trust provides a customer credit equal to the charge for customers. Visit www.pge.com/billexplanation for additional details on charge item.
Gas Public Purpose Program (PPP) Surcharge. Used to fund state-mandated gas assistance programs for low-income customers, energy efficiency programs, and public-interest research and development.

From March 1, 2022 to February 28, 2023, the Wildfire Fund Charge is offset by $\$ 0.00109 / \mathrm{kWh}$ to reflect excess funds from the Department of Water Resources (DWR) Bond charge. The Wildfire Fund Charge is also offset by an additional $\$ 0.00084 / \mathrm{kWh}$ during this same period for excess funds from the DWR Power charge. These charges were included in your electric charges prior to 2021 and were related to bonds issued and energy provided to customers by DWR during the 2000-2001 California energy crisis.

## Important definitions

Rotating outage blocks are subject to change without advance notice due to operational conditions.
Tier 1/Baseline allowance: Some residential rates are given a Tier 1/Baseline allowance - a CPUC approved percentage of average customer usage during summer and winter months. Your Tier 1/Baseline allowance provides for basic needs at an affordable price and encourages conservation. Your allowance is assigned based on the climate where you live, the season and your heat source. As you use more energy, you pay more for usage. Any usage over your baseline allowance will be charged at a higher price.
High Usage: An increased price per kWh whenever electricity usage exceeds four times the Baseline Allowance (Tier 1) in a billing period. This charge does not apply to Time-of-Use rate plans.

Wildfire Fund Charge: Charge on behalf of the State of California Department of Water Resources (DWR) to fund the California Wildfire Fund. For usage prior to October 1, 2020, this charge included costs related to the 2001 California energy crisis, also collected on behalf of the DWR. These charges belong to DWR, not PG\&E.
Power Charge Indifference Adjustment (PCIA): The PCIA is a charge to ensure that both PG\&E customers and those who have left PG\&E service to purchase electricity from other providers pay for the above market costs for electric generation resources that were procured by PG\&E on their behalf. 'Above market' refers to the difference between what the utility pays for electric generation and current market prices for the sale of those resources. Visit www.pge.com/cca.
Wildfire Hardening Charge: PG\&E has been permitted to issue bonds that enable it to recover more quickly certain costs related to preventing and mitigating catastrophic wildfires, while reducing the total cost to its customers. Your bill for electric service includes a fixed recovery charge called the Wildfire Hardening Charge that has been approved by the CPUC to repay those bonds. The right to recover the Wildfire Hardening Charge has been transferred to a separate entity (called the Special Purpose Entity) that issued the bonds and does not belong to PG\&E. PG\&E is collecting the Wildfire Hardening Charge on behalf of the Special Purpose Entity. For details visit: www.pge.com/fariffs/assets/pdf/fariffbook/ELEC_PRELIM_JF.pdf.
Recovery Bond Charge/Credit. Your bill for electric service includes a charge that has been approved by the CPUC to repay bonds issued for certain costs related to catastrophic wildfires. Separately, a PG\&E trust provides a customer credit equal to the charge for customers. Visit www.pge.com/billexplanation for additional details on charge item.
Gas Public Purpose Program (PPP) Surcharge. Used to fund state-mandated gas assistance programs for low-income customers, energy efficiency programs, and public-interest research and development.

## Important definitions

Rotating outage blocks are subject to change without advance notice due to operational conditions.
Tier 1/Baseline allowance: Some residential rates are given a Tier 1/Baseline allowance - a CPUC approved percentage of average customer usage during summer and winter months. Your Tier 1/Baseline allowance provides for basic needs at an affordable price and encourages conservation. Your allowance is assigned based on the climate where you live, the season and your heat source. As you use more energy, you pay more for usage. Any usage over your baseline allowance will be charged at a higher price.
High Usage: An increased price per kWh whenever electricity usage exceeds four times the Baseline Allowance (Tier 1) in a billing period. This charge does not apply to Time-of-Use rate plans.

Wildfire Fund Charge: Charge on behalf of the State of California Department of Water Resources (DWR) to fund the California Wildfire Fund. For usage prior to October 1, 2020, this charge included costs related to the 2001 California energy crisis, also collected on behalf of the DWR. These charges belong to DWR, not PG\&E.
Power Charge Indifference Adjustment (PCIA): The PCIA is a charge to ensure that both PG\&E customers and those who have left PG\&E service to purchase electricity from other providers pay for the above market costs for electric generation resources that were procured by PG\&E on their behalf. 'Above market' refers to the difference between what the utility pays for electric generation and current market prices for the sale of those resources. Visit www.pge.com/cca.
Wildfire Hardening Charge: PG\&E has been permitted to issue bonds that enable it to recover more quickly certain costs related to preventing and mitigating catastrophic wildfires, while reducing the total cost to its customers. Your bill for electric service includes a fixed recovery charge called the Wildfire Hardening Charge that has been approved by the CPUC to repay those bonds. The right to recover the Wildfire Hardening Charge has been transferred to a separate entity (called the Special Purpose Entity) that issued the bonds and does not belong to PG\&E. PG\&E is collecting the Wildfire Hardening Charge on behalf of the Special Purpose Entity. For details visit: www.pge.com/tariffs/assets/pdf/tariffbook/ELEC_PRELIM_JF.pdf.
Recovery Bond Charge/Credit: Your bill for electric service includes a charge that has been approved by the CPUC to repay bonds issued for certain costs related to catastrophic wildfires. Separately, a PG\&E trust provides a customer credit equal to the charge for customers. Visit www.pge.com/billexplanation for additional details on charge item.
Gas Public Purpose Program (PPP) Surcharge. Used to fund state-mandated gas assistance programs for low-income customers, energy efficiency programs, and public-interest research and development.

From March 1, 2022 to February 28, 2023, the Wildfire Fund Charge is offset by $\$ 0.00109 / \mathrm{kWh}$ to reflect excess funds from the Department of Water Resources (DWR) Bond charge. The Wildfire Fund Charge is also offset by an additional $\$ 0.00084 / \mathrm{kWh}$ during this same period for excess funds from the DWR Power charge. These charges were included in your electric charges prior to 2021 and were related to bonds issued and energy provided to customers by DWR during the 2000-2001 California energy crisis.

## Important definitions

Rolating outage blocks are subject to change without advance notice due to operational conditions.
Tier 1/Baseline allowance: Some residential rates are given a Tier 1/Baseline allowance - a CPUC approved percentage of average customer usage during summer and winter months. Your Tier 1/Baseline allowance provides for basic needs at an affordable price and encourages conservation. Your allowance is assigned based on the climate where you live, the season and your heat source. As you use more energy, you pay more for usage. Any usage over your baseline allowance will be charged at a higher price.
High Usage: An increased price per kWh whenever electricity usage exceeds four times the Baseline Allowance (Tier 1) in a billing period. This charge does not apply to Time-of-Use rate plans.

Wildfire Fund Charge: Charge on behalf of the State of California Department of Water Resources (DWR) to fund the California Wildfire Fund. For usage prior to October 1, 2020, this charge included costs related to the 2001 California energy crisis, also collected on behalf of the DWR. These charges belong to DWR, not PG\&E.
Power Charge Indifference Adjustment (PCIA): The PCIA is a charge to ensure that both PG\&E customers and those who have left PG\&E service to purchase electricity from other providers pay for the above market costs for electric generation resources that were procured by PG\&E on their behalf. 'Above market' refers to the difference between what the utility pays for electric generation and current market prices for the sale of those resources. Visit www.pge.com/cca.
Wildfire Hardening Charge: PG\&E has been permitted to issue bonds that enable it to recover more quickly certain costs related to preventing and mitigating catastrophic wildfires, while reducing the total cost to its customers. Your bill for electric service includes a fixed recovery charge called the Wildfire Hardening Charge that has been approved by the CPUC to repay those bonds. The right to recover the Wildfire Hardening Charge has been transferred to a separate entity (called the Special Purpose Entity) that issued the bonds and does not belong to PG\&E. PG\&E is collecting the Wildfire Hardening Charge on behalf of the Special Purpose Entity. For details visit: www.pge.com/tariffs/assets/pdf/tarifbook/ELEC_PRELIM_JF.pdf.
Recovery Bond Charge/Gredit: Your bill for electric service includes a charge that has been approved by the CPUC to repay bonds issued for certain costs related to catastrophic wildfires. Separately, a PG\&E trust provides a customer credit equal to the charge for customers. Visit www.pge.com/billexplanation for additional details on charge item.
Gas Public Purpose Program (PPP) Surcharge. Used to fund state-mandated gas assistance programs for low-income customers, energy efficiency programs, and public-interest research and development.
