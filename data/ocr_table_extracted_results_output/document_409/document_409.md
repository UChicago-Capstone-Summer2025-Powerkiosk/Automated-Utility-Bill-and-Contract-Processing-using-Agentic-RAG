Buyer acknowledges and understands that, in connection with this transaction, Seller may be paying a fee to a third party. The fee, if any, would be included in Buyer's price and would be charged by a broker/agent representing Buyer, a broker/agent representing Seller, or an association/referrer who helped facilitate this transaction.

100\% Swing: The rate for all volumes consumed during the Delivery Period shall be the Contract Price listed herein, excluding any quantities fixed under a separate transaction confirmation.

Customer must notify Constellation of any Material Variation in usage. A "Material Variation" is defined as an increase or decrease of twenty (20) percent from the previous twelve (12) months' usage for each respective month. Variations related to weather are not considered a Material Variation. Notwithstanding anything in the Transaction Confirmation to the contrary, the rate for any Material Variation in consumption may be based on the then-current spot market price, as determined by Constellation in its reasonable discretion.

# Constellation. 

If Constellation and Customer have previously entered into any commodity transaction(s) for the Facility (the "Previous Transaction") that overlap one or more of the delivery months covered in this Transaction Confirmation (the "Overlapping Month(s)"), the incremental gas pricing in this Transaction Confirmation shall apply to the Overlapping Months instead of any conflicting incremental gas pricing associated with the Previous Transaction.

Should an operational flow order, or other utility or pipeline restrictions occur, Constellation will attempt to adjust Customer's daily nomination to match expected usage as determined by Constellation. The pricing of incremental volumes associated with the nomination adjustment will be based on then current spot market price, as determined by Constellation in its reasonable discretion.

Allocation: Constellation will allocate the Contract Quantity listed herein among the Customer's separate facilities or meters at a later date.

Seller's planned billing method for this facility is to bill Buyer based on: Actual Consumption
Change In Law: Constellation may pass through or allocate, as the case may be, to Customer any increase or decrease in Constellation's costs related to the natural gas and related products and services sold to Customer that results from the implementation of new, or changes (including changes to transportation rates) to existing, Laws, or other requirements or changes in administration or interpretation of Laws or other requirements. "Law" means any law, rule, regulation, ordinance, statute, judicial decision, administrative order, pipeline or utility business practices or protocol, pipeline or utility tariff, or rule of any commission or agency with federal jurisdiction or jurisdiction in the state in which the facility is located. Such adjusted amounts will be included in subsequent invoices to Customer.

Default Service : Should Constellation continue to deliver to Customer beyond the term of this Transaction Confirmation, said deliveries will be made for successive 1 month terms (each an "Extension Term"), until terminated by either party by giving written notice of termination not less than 30 days prior to the expiration of the then-current Extension Term. The price for gas delivered during the Extension Term(s) will be based on market prices as determined by Constellation. Unless otherwise provided by Customer, Constellation will determine Customer's monthly nomination in a commercially reasonable manner based upon Customer's historical usage data.
