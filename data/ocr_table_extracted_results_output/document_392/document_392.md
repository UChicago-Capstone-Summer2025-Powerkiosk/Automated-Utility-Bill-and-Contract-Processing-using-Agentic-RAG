1.1 Purchase and Sale. ENGIE shall sell and deliver and Customer shall purchase and receive Firm Full Requirements Service. Customer's consumption is variable and not subject to a maximum or minimum usage limit, however Customer may not close a facility or service location or otherwise discontinue electric service prior to the End Date.
1.2 Term. Service shall commence on the first available Utility Transfer Date on or following the Start Date as specified in Attachment A, Exhibit 1. Service shall remain through the first available Utility Transfer Date following the End Date. Customer's options for service beyond the End Date are: i) executing a new agreement with ENGIE, ii) transferring to another supplier, or iii) providing a written request to ENGIE to transfer service to the default service provider. If Customer does not exercise an option prior to the End Date, ENGIE may continue providing post-term service on a month-to-month basis. The price for post-term service shall be a monthly variable rate set by ENGIE plus a post-term charge and any applicable non-utility related charges, ISO charges or administrative fees. Taxes and Utility Related Charges are separately listed in an invoice. The post-term price may include a broker fee. Customer may terminate post-term service at any time without liability. The Utility Transfer Date is the date which the utility permits ENGIE to commence or discontinue Customer's service. ENGIE is not responsible or liable for any loss, cost, charge, or fee incurred by or assessed to Customer for a delay in enrollment. Customer understands third parties are, in part, responsible for enrollment timeliness. Customer may request ENGIE offer a "blend and extend" agreement for Customer to benefit from lower rates in exchange for a Term extension.
1.3 Billing and Payment. For each Billing Cycle, ENGIE will deliver to Customer an invoice of charges due for the preceding Billing Cycle. ENGIE may use estimated data subject to reconciliation upon receipt of final data. Payment shall be by check or electronic funds transfer (EFT) within 20 days after the date of invoice. For ETF, Customer shall provide account information and authorize ENGIE to collect payment by automatic draft from Customer's bank account. Overdue payments will accrue interest at the interest rate of $1 \frac{1}{2} \%$ per month from the due date to the date of payment. ENGIE may report payment history to credit agencies. If an invoice is disputed in good faith, the entire invoice shall be paid when due. Any disputed amounts that are ultimately determined to be owed to Customer shall be repaid by ENGIE. An invoice dispute is waived unless raised within 24 months after the invoice is rendered or an adjustment is made. This time limitation shall not apply to revised or adjusted billing if such revision or adjustment is a result outside of the control of ENGIE including but not limited to revised or corrected usage from a utility or other utility related charges. ENGIE may sell its receivables to the utility pursuant to its purchase of receivables ("POR") program; the terms and conditions of the POR program shall control.

It may include a broker fee and includes non-utility charges including energy, ancillary services, congestion, capacity, losses, and current network integrated transmission and transmission enhancement charges (provided that changes to rate effective after contract execution may be passed through to Customer).
1.5 Costs Not Included in the Contract Price. The Contract Price does not include Taxes, Utility Related Charges, or Reliability Must Run charges. Installed (or unforced) capacity costing may be adjusted by the final net load clearing price, zonal scaling factors and forecast pool requirement for periods outside the PJM RPM Base Residual Auction rates cleared as of the contract date.
1.6 Conditions to Transact. Service may be conditioned upon a credit screen by ENGIE; a review of Customer's recent invoices, verification of a satisfactory credit score, or the requirement that Customer provide credit support such as cash deposit, letter of credit or alternate means of bill payment.
