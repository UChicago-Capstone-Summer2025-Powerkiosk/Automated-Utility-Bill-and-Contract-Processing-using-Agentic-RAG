This TC is entered into pursuant to and in accordance with a Master Agreement executed on
by and between Constellation NewEnergy, Inc. ("Seller") and Dunn Paper - East Hartford, LLC. dba BiOrigin Specialty Products ("Customer"), and is subject to all of the provisions, terms and conditions of such Master Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, any conflict between this TC and the Master Agreement will be resolved in favor of this TC, but only with respect to the Account(s) listed on this TC. This TC supersedes all prior agreements and understandings with respect to the Account(s), and may not be contradicted by any prior or contemporaneous oral or written agreement. Capitalized terms used herein but not defined will have the meanings ascribed to them in the Master Agreement.

Price Terms. The prices contained in the Account Schedule include all the costs listed below as "Fixed", meaning that they will remain constant for the existing term of this TC and may only be subject to change as a result of a Change in Law as described in the Master Agreement. Costs listed below as "Passed Through" means that charges for these costs will change during the existing term of this TC if and as the related charges vary for any reason. Seller will pass through Energy Costs using the market index prices based on the hourly (or sub-hourly in some markets) day ahead locational marginal price for the ISO zone applicable to each Account identified in the Account Schedule. At any time during the term of this TC, the Parties may enter into one or more Retail Trade Transactions ("RTTs"), which shall be evidenced by a fully executed RTT Confirmation. Such RTTs may cover the purchase of: (1) blocks of electricity to fix Customer's price for energy for a fixed hourly amount of power (an "Electric Block'); and (2) renewable energy certificates in an amount equal to a prescribed percentage of Customer's load volume. The Electric Block RTT Confirmation will specify the hourly amount of power, the hours of the day and days of the week in which the power will be delivered, and the specific zone in which the power will be delivered. If the electricity needs of Customer's Account are less than the Electric Block in any hour (or sub-hour in some markets), Seller shall settle the unused Electric Block volumes at the difference between the price of the Electric Block and the day ahead locational marginal price. If the electricity needs of Customer's Account exceed the Electric Block electricity in any hour (or sub-hour in some markets), Seller shall invoice Customer for any excess usage at the day ahead locational marginal price. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement shall relieve Customer from its obligation to pay for the entire volume of all Electric Blocks.
Cost Components. Each of the items listed as "Fixed" below is included in Customer's contract prices as set forth in the Account Schedule. For each of the items listed as "Passed Through" below, Customer will be charged the costs associated with the line item in accordance with the definitions of each item in Section 1.1, Definitions.
