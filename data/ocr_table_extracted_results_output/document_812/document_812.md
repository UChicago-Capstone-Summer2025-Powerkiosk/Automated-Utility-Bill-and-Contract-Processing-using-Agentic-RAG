# ELECTRICITY SUPPLY AGREEMENT <br> DISCLOSURE STATEMENT 

## 1. Overview.

This Disclosure Statement supplements and forms a part of the Agreement between Seller and Customer. Seller agrees to sell and Customer agrees to buy the quantity of electricity supply meeting Customer's full requirements at each Facility specified on the Facility Attachment. Seller will arrange for the delivery of electricity by the relevant EDC to each Facility. The EDC will then deliver or distribute the electricity to each Facility.

Seller is licensed by the Commission as an electric generation supplier to offer and supply electric generation services in Pennsylvania under license no. A-20162575063. Generation prices and charges are set by Seller. The Commission regulates distribution prices and services. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ("FERC") regulates transmission prices and services.
2. Term.

Seller shall endeavor to start deliveries of electricity to the Facility(ies) on or after the Estimated Start Date. However, Customer acknowledges that (i) the Service Start Date is dependent upon the relevant EDC confirming to Seller that it has completed all required enrollment processes and (ii) if the enrollment is completed by the EDC after the Estimated Start Date, Seller will not incur any liability for such delayed start. The initial term of this Agreement will run from the Service Start Date through the Service End Date (the "Initial Term"), unless earlier cancelled as provided herein.
3. Renewal.

If you are a Small Business Customer and have a fixed term contract approaching the expiration date, or whenever we propose to change the terms of service in any type of contract, you will receive two separate written notifications that precede either the expiration date or the effective date of the proposed changes. These notifications will explain your options going forward.

If you are Large Business Customer, we may send you a Notice prior to the expiration of the Initial Term.
At the end of the Initial Term, if no action is taken, the Agreement shall automatically continue on a month-to-month basis at a variable price as specified in Section 4 below, unless and until cancelled by either Party after providing the other Party with prior Notice. There is no Cancellation Payment if the Agreement is cancelled after the end of the Initial Term.
4. Customer Charges.

If you are a Small Business Customer, for each billing cycle during the term, the amount to be charged to Customer by Seller for each Facility shall be the sum of (i) the Commodity Charges and (ii) all applicable Taxes (collectively, the "Seller Charges"). The Price includes the Cost Components indicated on the Coversheet, Generation Charges and Transmission Charges (if not already included in the Cost Components).

If you are a Large Commercial Customer, for each billing cycle during the term, the amount to be charged to Customer by Seller for each Facility shall be the sum of (i) the Commodity Charges, (ii) the amount assessed by Seller for any Cost Components for such billing cycle that are not indicated on the Coversheet as being included in the Price for such Facility, (iii) all applicable Taxes and (iv) any costs and charges assessed pursuant to Sections 7 or 8 hereof (collectively, the "Seller Charges").

The Price excludes the Distribution Charges and other costs and fees for services provided by the EDC (the "EDC Charges"). The Price also excludes all applicable Taxes (including the gross receipts tax).

After the expiration of the Initial Term, the Price per kWh will be variable as determined by Seller based on various factors, including competitors' prices, applicable industry charges, wholesale market conditions, electricity supply sources plus a margin and may change monthly. This list of factors is not exhaustive and no single factor will determine the rate. Some factors must be estimated or projected. The factors considered by the Seller may be weighed differently each month. The variable rate may not correlate with changes in the wholesale market prices or your local EDC prices. The variable rate may be higher than your local EDC or other supplier rates. There is no limit on how much the variable price may change from one billing cycle to the next. If Customer is a Small Business Customer, Customer can obtain next month's variable price by contacting Seller using the contact information in Section 22 .
5. Billing and Payment.

With respect to each Facility, Customer may receive one consolidated bill from the relevant EDC each bill cycle for both the EDC Charges and the applicable Seller Charges (the "Utility Consolidated Billing" or "UCB") and the bill will be sent to the billing address on file with the Utility.

In such case, Customer agrees to remit payment for all amounts reflected on such invoice directly to the EDC in accordance with the EDC's payment terms.

Alternatively, if the EDC does not provide consolidated billing or the Parties agree to dual billing, Customer will, each bill cycle, receive one bill from the EDC for the EDC Charges (payable to the EDC) and a second bill from Seller for the applicable Seller Charges (payable to Seller) (the "Dual Billing"). In such case, Customer agrees to remit payment of all amounts reflected on Seller's invoice directly to Seller no later than 20 (twenty) days from the date of billing. All payments to Seller are to be mailed to PO Box 733615, Dallas, TX 75373-3615. All invoices will include amounts for applicable Taxes.

Depending on the bill format, charges assessed to Large Commercial Customers pursuant to Sections 7 or 8 hereof may appear on Customer's bill as a line item or Price adjustment. Regardless of billing method, invoices may cover multiple Facilities where applicable.

Unpaid balances on Customer's account(s) not received by the due date specified on the invoice will be subject to a late charge of the lesser of $1.50 \%$ per month or the maximum permitted by Law (the "Interest Rate"). Seller will charge a $\$ 35$ return check fee for all returned checks. Seller is not responsible for notifying Customer of any failed or returned payments.

Seller may apply any credit balance on a particular Facility to a balance owed on any other Facility supplied by Seller. Seller will include or cause to be included in any subsequent bill from Seller, adjustments related to previous billings, including estimates, billing or meter read errors, or other errors or omissions.

If Customer disputes the Seller Charges on any bill, Customer must pay any undisputed portion of the bill by the applicable due date. If the unpaid, disputed portion of the bill is subsequently resolved in favor of Seller, the Interest Rate will be applied to such unpaid amounts. Customer will be responsible for the costs of all collection activity, including reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements incurred by Seller in enforcing the terms of this Agreement.
6. Taxes

Customer shall pay all applicable Taxes associated with sales under, and/or performance of, this Agreement. The Price does not include gross receipts tax or applicable state and local sales Taxes. Seller may collect Taxes from Customer by including them on any invoice. Where the Customer claims to be tax exempt, Customer shall provide written evidence of any tax exemption to Seller and each relevant EDC. Seller will recognize a lawful tax exemption on a prospective basis only after Customer provides proper documentation to Seller. Customer shall be liable for, and shall indemnify Seller against, any Taxes and associated interest or penalties assessed against Seller by any third party due to Customer's failure to timely provide or properly and accurately complete any such evidence.
7. Change in Usage.

Customer shall provide Seller with timely Notice of any change in the attributes or use of any Facility (including any event) that is likely to result in a load change of $\underline{25} \%$ or more as compared to the Forecasted Volume ( a "Change in Usage"). Examples of such changes may include equipment outages, shutdowns or replacements, on-site generation, openings or closings, and/or changes in operating hours. A Large Commercial Customer shall be responsible for payment of any additional costs and/or losses incurred by Seller resulting from such Change in Usage.
8. Regulatory Change.

If there is a Regulatory Change which causes Seller to incur new or modified fees, costs or charges Seller reserves the right to pass through the fees, costs or charges associated with the Regulatory Change to a Large Commercial Customer without markup. For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties agree that a change in the rate classification of a Facility will be deemed a Regulatory Change. The changes described in this Section may impact any or all of the charges described in this Agreement, whether described as "fixed," "variable," "included," "passed through" or otherwise.
9. Early Cancellation.

If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing with respect to Customer, Seller shall have the right to (i) designate an early cancellation date (the "Early Cancellation Date") to accelerate all amounts owing between the Parties and to liquidate and cancel any or all Transactions (each, a "Cancelled Transaction"), (ii) withhold any payments due to Customer and/or (iii) suspend performance of its obligations under this Agreement. Seller shall give prior Notice to Customer if required by the applicable Law. In addition to the other remedies specified herein, upon the occurrence of an Event of Default with respect to Customer, Seller shall be permitted to switch Customer to receive Default Service at each Facility. Seller's sales of electricity supply to Customer at each Facility shall be treated as separate transactions (each, a "Transaction") under this Agreement. Subject to Seller's rights and remedies hereunder (including those described in Section 10 below), Customer may cancel this Agreement by giving 30-day prior Notice to Seller (unless a different notice period is required by the applicable Law) and shall pay any amounts owed hereunder in connection with such cancellation and for the electricity supplied up to the effective date of cancellation.

# freepoint 

10. Penalties and Fees.

On an Early Cancellation Date, Seller shall close out each Cancelled Transaction so that each such Cancelled Transaction is terminated and shall calculate and aggregate the Cancellation Payment for all Cancelled Transactions. The Parties agree that a Cancelled Transaction will become effective after the Facility drop has been processed by the applicable Utility and the Facility is no longer supplied under the Agreement and, in case there are multiple Cancelled Transactions, the effective cancellation date will be whichever occurs last (the "Effective Cancellation Date"). In determining the Cancellation Payment, Seller (i) need not actually enter into replacement transactions, (ii) may utilize the Forecasted Volume or any other Customer-related information it deems relevant to determine the quantity of electricity to be purchased by Customer for the remaining term of any Cancelled Transactions, and (iii) may consider, among other valuations, any settlement prices of New York Mercantile Exchange electric energy futures contracts, internal curves, quotations from leading dealers in electric energy swap contracts, and other bona fide party bids and offers, which may include, on an arms' length basis, offers from Seller's affiliates, all adjusted for the remainder of the applicable term and basis differentials.

Customer shall pay the Cancellation Payment to Seller within three (3) Business Days of Customer's receipt of Notice of the amount thereof from Seller, provided that Seller may set off the amount of any Collateral provided by Customer and held by it under this Agreement against the amount of the Cancellation Payment. Irrespective of whether a Cancellation Payment is owed hereunder, Customer shall pay to Seller the Seller Charges incurred up to the Effective Cancellation Date. Seller will refund any Collateral surplus after Customer's obligations to Seller have been paid in full. Customer acknowledges and stipulates that the payment obligations set forth herein are difficult to estimate and represent a reasonable approximation of the anticipated harm or loss to Seller as a result of an Event of Default with respect to Customer.
11. Credit.

If, at any time during the term of this Agreement, Seller determines that (a) Customer has failed to timely pay any amounts due under this Agreement, or (b) Seller has reasonable grounds for insecurity with respect to Customer's creditworthiness, Seller may require that Customer provide (in addition to any Collateral previously provided) Collateral for its obligations under this Agreement. Customer hereby grants to Seller, as security for the payment and performance of Customer's obligations under this Agreement, a first priority continuing lien and security interest in and to any Collateral (and proceeds and products thereof) that Customer has or may deliver to Seller. When making a request for Collateral, Seller shall comply with its license requirements (if applicable) and any other deposit requirements required by the Commission. Any Collateral provided by Customer will be held as required by the applicable Law.
12. Limitation of Liability: Disclaimer of Warranties: Indemnity.

EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PARTIES' LIABILITY HEREUNDER IS LIMITED TO DIRECT DAMAGES AS THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY AND ALL OTHER REMEDIES OR DAMAGES AT LAW OR IN EQUITY ARE EXPRESSLY WAIVED. IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR ANY BUSINESS INTERRUPTION DAMAGES. CUSTOMER HEREBY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO PARTICIPATE AS A PLAINTIFY IN A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT AGAINST SELLER IN CONNECTION WITH ANY CLAIM, CAUSE OF ACTION, ACTION OR PROCEEDING RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT. SELLER MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OTHER THAN THOSE EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS AND NEGATES ALL OTHER REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR REPRESENTATIONS ABOUT GUARANTEED SAVINGS. WITH RESPECT TO ELECTRICITY SOLD BY SELLER, CUSTOMER INDEMNIFIES, DEFENDS, AND HOLDS HARMLESS SELLER FROM ANY CLAIMS ARISING FROM ANY ACT OR INCIDENT OCCURRING AT OR AFTER DELIVERY OF ELECTRICITY TO CUSTOMER. CUSTOMER HEREBY WAIVES TO THE FULLEST EXTENT ALLOWED BY THE APPLICABLE LAW ITS RIGHTS UNDER ALL LAWS, RULES, REGULATIONS AND ORDERS PERTAINING TO RETAIL ELECTRICITY SUPPLY, INCLUDING RIGHTS RELATED CUSTOMER DISCLOSURES, DELIVERY OF CUSTOMER CONTRACTS TO CUSTOMERS, SPANISH LANGUAGE, RECORD KEEPING, INTEREST PAID ON DEPOSITS AND CUSTOMER NOTICES.
13. Governing Law

This Agreement and the rights and duties of the Parties under this Agreement are governed by the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, without regard to conflict of law principles. To the maximum extent possible under the Law, article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code will apply to the electricity sold under this Agreement. EACH PARTY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT.

# 14. Assignment 

Customer may not assign this Agreement or any of its rights or obligations hereunder without Seller's prior written consent which shall not be unreasonably withheld. Seller may assign this Agreement and its rights and obligations hereunder upon Notice to Customer. Any assignee hereof shall be subject to all the provisions and conditions of this Agreement as applicable to its assignor to the same extent as though such assignee were an original Party to this Agreement. If this Agreement is assigned, its terms and conditions will remain the same, unless otherwise agreed in a signed writing by the Parties. This Agreement will inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns. Any assignment in violation of this Section shall be void.
15. Force Majeure.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if a Party is unable to carry out any obligation under this Agreement due to Force Majeure (other than a payment obligation relating to performance provided prior to or during the Force Majeure, which shall not be excused for Force Majeure), this Agreement will remain in effect but such obligation will be suspended for the duration of the Force Majeure, provided: (i) the claiming Party notifies the other Party as soon as practicable in writing of the particulars of the Force Majeure; (ii) suspension of performance is of no greater scope and duration than required by the Force Majeure; and (iii) the claiming Party uses commercially reasonable efforts to remedy its inability to perform. If the Force Majeure continues for a period of 30 days or more where Customer is the declaring Party, then Seller may cancel this Agreement with respect to the Facilities adversely affected by the Force Majeure upon 15 days' prior Notice to Customer. It is expressly agreed by the Parties that the ability of Seller to sell the products and services provided hereunder at a greater price, and the ability of Customer to purchase the products and services provided hereunder for a lower price, than the price specified herein shall not constitute an event of Force Majeure. Seller is not responsible for transmitting or distributing electric energy. In the event of a power outage, Customer should contact the relevant EDC.

The Notices shall be delivered, with respect to Customer, to the address specified on the Coversheet. Customer agrees to inform Seller if any of the contact information provided on the Coversheet changes. The Notices shall be delivered, with respect to Seller, as specified in the "Contact Information" Section below.
Notice by electronic mail or hand delivery will be deemed received by close of the Business Day transmitted or delivered (if transmitted or delivered after that close, it will be deemed received by the close of the next Business Day). Notice by overnight courier will be deemed received by close of the Business Day on the day delivered. Notice by U.S. mail will be deemed received by the close of the third Business Day

after the date of mailing. A Party may change its address or contact information by providing Notice to the other Party in accordance herewith. Customer shall keep its contact information updated and provide Seller with prior Notice of any changes.
19. Acknowledgements.

Each Party agrees, understands and acknowledges that: (a) this Agreement is a "forward contract" and a "master netting agreement" as defined in the United States Bankruptcy Code (the "Code"); (b) this Agreement shall not be construed as creating an association, trust, partnership, or joint venture in any way between the Parties, nor as creating any relationship between the Parties other than that of independent contractors for the sale and purchase of a commodity; (c) Seller is not a "utility" as defined in the Code; (d) commodity supply will be provided by Seller under this Agreement, but delivery will be provided by the Customer's EDC; and (e) Customer's EDC, and not Seller, is responsible for responding to outages, leaks or emergencies should they occur.

At any time during the Initial Term (but not more frequently than once during any six-month period), Customer may request Seller to provide new price quotes for its full electricity supply requirements or a part thereof, for the remaining Initial Term, a part thereof or an extended term (the "Conversion Option"). Seller shall endeavor to provide Customer non-binding quotes for the Conversion Option, provided that Seller does not guarantee staff availability for execution of any Conversion Option at a specific price or for a specific term, and provided further that Seller shall not be liable for failure to provide price quotes or execute any specific addendum therefor. No agreement for a Conversion Option will be deemed to exist between the Parties unless and until an addendum to this Agreement or superseding electricity supply agreement is executed and delivered by the Parties. For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties agree that if no such addendum or superseding agreement is entered into by the Parties, the Parties' respective rights and obligations will remain governed by and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.
21. Additional Special Provisions for Small Business Customers.
(a) Information on generation energy sources, energy efficiency, environmental impacts or historical billing data is available upon request by Small Business Customers.
(b) If the Price is not fixed and is based on an index and the index is not announced or published on any day for any reason or if the Seller reasonably determines that a material change in the formula for or the method of determining the index has occurred, then Seller will use a commercially reasonable replacement price that is calculated by the Seller. Seller makes no representations about guaranteed savings.
(c) If Small Business Customer needs historical variable price information, it may obtain the average monthly billed rates for the previous 24 months (or for the months available to date) for Small Business Customers with the same rate class and located in the same EDC service territory who have received service on a variable rate by calling or e-mailing Seller at the telephone number or e-mail address set forth below. Historical rates are not indicative of present or future rates.
(d) In the event there is a Regulatory Change or a Change in Usage and as a result of such change we incur additional costs, losses and/or expenses in performing our obligations under this Agreement or whenever we propose to change the terms of service in any type of contract, we will treat this as a contract change and you will receive two separate written notices that precede the effective date of the proposed changes. The first of these notices will occur between 60-45 days prior to the effective date of the proposed contract change, the second of these notices will occur at least 30 days prior to the effective date of the proposed contract change. If, after receipt of the notices, you affirmatively consent to the proposed changes, this Agreement will continue with the changed terms incorporated into it. If you take no action before the deadline set forth in the notices, we will cancel the Agreement and the affected Facilities will be switched to the Default Service provided by the applicable EDC. You will not be charged a penalty or early cancellation fee in connection with such cancellation but you will be responsible for any unpaid Seller Charges incurred prior to the cancellation of the Agreement.

This Agreement may be executed in several counterparts, each of which will be an original and all of which constitute one and the same Agreement. Each Party may assume that all notices and emails sent from the other Party have been sent by an authorized representative of such other Party. Title and risk of loss to electricity will pass from Seller to Customer at the relevant Delivery Point(s). Subject to the rights that may accrue to any successors or permitted assignees of the Parties, no provision of this Agreement is to be construed as creating any rights enforceable by a third party, and all third party beneficiary rights are expressly negated.

Customer agrees that compensation owed to any third party representing Customer in connection with this Agreement may be included in the Price and Customer will indemnify and defend Seller against, and hold Seller harmless from, any Claims made by any such third party (including for amounts owed to any such third party that are not included in the Price) and any costs incurred by Seller with respect to such Claims (including legal fees and disbursements).
