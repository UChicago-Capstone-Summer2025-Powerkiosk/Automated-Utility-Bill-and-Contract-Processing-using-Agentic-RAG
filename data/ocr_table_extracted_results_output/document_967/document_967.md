# Routine maintenance improves reliability. 

BGE's commitment to electricity reliability goes beyond maintaining just the poles and lines - it extends to the trees surrounding more than 10,000 miles of overhead power lines. BGE invests more than $\$ 34$ million each year into our Tree and Vegetation Management Program, which includes assessing, pruning and removing trees that may cause electric outages, as well as managing vegetation above our underground natural gas transmission pipeline network.

All of this attention to trees has reduced tree-related service outages by nearly $40 \%$ since 2011. To learn more about how smart energy gets more reliable every day, visit BGE.COM/Reliability.

The image is a photo showing a worker in a bucket lift, wearing a hard hat, safety glasses, and a high-visibility jacket. The worker is using a pole saw to trim branches from a tree. The background includes tree branches and leaves. The focus is on the worker performing tree maintenance near power lines.

## BGE's Tree and Vegetation Management Program

## SCHEDULED MAINTENANCE

BGE's strategy is based on a four- or five-year trimming cycle, routine inspections and reliability performance data. BGE also further enhances tree and vegetation management efforts by implementing requirements mandated by the Maryland Public Service Commission, called the Electricity Service Quality and Reliability Act or RM 43 standards.

## PRUNING STANDARDS

BGE uses only licensed, utility-qualified, professional tree-trimming contractors to manage the trees and other vegetation around power lines and equipment. When a neighborhood is scheduled for routine tree and vegetation management work, BGE's contractors place door hangers to let property owners know when to expect crews. If heavy tree pruning or removal is required, the property owner will be directly contacted before work is commenced. If you have questions about the proposed work, call the BGE contractor directly by using the phone number on the door hanger. To learn more information on the program, visit BGE.COM/TreeCare.

The image is an illustration showing a stylized green tree with multiple leaves. In the background, there is a faint depiction of a utility pole with power lines. The tree is centrally placed, and the power lines run diagonally across the upper part of the image. The illustration emphasizes the relationship between trees and power lines, likely highlighting the importance of tree management near electrical infrastructure.

# TREE TRIMMING 

BGE encourages customers to manage the heights or spreads of their trees before they get within 10 feet of interfering with electrical lines and equipment. In addition, the Maryland High Voltage Line Act (HVLA) requires anyone working or using tools or equipment within 10 feet of overhead lines to contact BGE first at $\mathbf{8 0 0 . 6 8 5 . 0 1 2 3}$, to evaluate the site and plan how to best make the work area safe. To find a private licensed tree care contractor to prune or remove your trees, visit BGE.COM/TreeCare.

It depicts two stylized appliances. The appliance on the left is a tall, teal-colored unit with a vertical handle, resembling a refrigerator. The appliance on the right is a green, box-shaped unit with an open lid, resembling a chest freezer. The illustration uses a minimalistic and flat design style.

## DIG SAFE

Smart digging means always calling Miss Utility at 811 at least two full business days (but not more than 10 days) before you begin excavations on any project - from home landscaping and gardening to large construction jobs.

With one free call, representatives will visit your proposed dig site and mark the locations of underground electrical wires, gas pipelines and other utilities. Calling 811 before you dig is the first step in preventing damage to underground utilities that can cause serious injuries, disruptions of a neighborhood's critical services and expensive penalties and repair costs. For additional information, visit BGE.COM/811.

## PLANTING TREES

BGE recommends the Arbor Day Foundation's The Right Tree, the Right Place guideline which advises that any trees planted within 20 feet on either side of pole-to-pole power lines have a mature height of less than 25 feet. For more information on how to comply with the HVLA by choosing the right tree for the right place on your property please visit BGE.COM/TreeCare.

The image is a photo/illustration.

It depicts a stylized neighborhood scene with two houses and a garage. The houses are illustrated with simple geometric shapes and are colored in shades of yellow and orange. The background is green with a few stylized trees and clouds, giving a suburban feel. The houses are positioned side by side, with the garage in between them.

## Tree-mendous community efforts.

Since 2013, BGE has donated more than $\$ 650,000$ to the Arbor Day Foundation to help improve the area's tree canopy.
> More than 25,000 free trees have been donated directly to customers through the Energy Saving Trees Program.
> BGE has also partnered with Blue Water Baltimore, an organization committed to increasing Baltimore's tree canopy.
