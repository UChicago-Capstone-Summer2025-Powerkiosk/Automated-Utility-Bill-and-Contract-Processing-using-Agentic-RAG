2. ELECTRIC SUPPLY. During the Initial Term and any Holdover Period, Company shall supply Customer's full electricity requirements for the Account(s), and Customer shall obtain its full electricity requirements for such Account(s) exclusively from Company, all based on the terms and conditions specified in this Agreement. Subject to terms and conditions of this Agreement, Company shall cause electricity to be delivered to the Delivery Point(s) and Customer shall receive such electricity at the Delivery Point(s). Notwithstanding the foregoing, Company shall be under no obligation to supply any Accounts under a residential rate class and, if Company does supply such Accounts, Customer hereby represents and warrants to Company that such Accounts are used for commercial or governmental purposes.
3. CUSTOMER INFORMATION. Customer hereby authorizes Company to obtain or access from the Utility and/or Customer current and historical electricity cost and usage data of Customer, Customer's payment and credit history, and other information generally relevant to the supply and associated services to be supplied under this Agreement. Customer agrees to provide additional documentation regarding such authorization as requested by Company.

Customer agrees to take steps to cooperate with Company's efforts to perform enrollment of Accounts for supply under this Agreement. Customer understands the Utility determines final enrollment and agrees that Company is not liable for any delay or failure in enrolling Customer's Account(s) if such delay or failure is

due to incorrect Account information, invalid Account numbers, and/or any other cause beyond Company's control. Further, notwithstanding any provision in the Agreement to the contrary, it is possible that for various reasons such as the Account not existing, Account not active, Account is not the "first in" and/or a required permit for the Account is not valid with the Utility, some or all the Accounts cannot be enrolled. All such un-enrolled Accounts shall be automatically deleted from the list of Accounts under this Agreement without an amendment to this Agreement. Company has the right to treat one or more failures to enroll any Accounts as an early termination of this Agreement. If one or more Accounts fail to enroll on a timely basis based on inaccurate information from Customer and/or any other cause beyond Company's control, Customer may, at the option of Company, be required to pay Company the Early Termination Fee due with respect to such Accounts. Company is not required to serve any such un-enrolled Accounts.

# 5. TERM OF AGREEMENT. 

This Agreement shall become effective on the Effective Date with electric supply commencing for each Account on the Service Commencement Date and continuing thereafter for the Initial Term. If, upon expiration of the Initial Term, Customer's Account(s) are not switched by the Utility to another TPS or Company and Customer do not enter into a new or renewal Agreement, this Agreement shall continue on a month-to-month basis until either Party terminates this Agreement in which event such termination shall be effective after the noticed termination date on the date on which Customer's Account(s) are switched to the Utility's standard service offer or another TPS, or Company and Customer enter into a new or renewal Agreement (the "Holdover Period").
6. PRICING. The Price for electric supply provided to Customer by Company during the Initial Term is set forth in the Agreement and subject to any adjustments set forth in this Agreement. Customer pays all Pass-Through Charges. Certain Pass-Through Charges imposed during the Initial Term may be set forth in the BEA or any addendum to this Agreement. Pass-Through Charges are charges to Customer, not credits. Depending on the bill format, certain Pass-Through Charges, such as those described in the BEA and this TOS, including those arising from one or more Change in Law events, may appear on the bill as a separate line item or an increase to the Price shown on the bill, at the option of Company.

The unit price for electricity during the Holdover Period shall be the Holdover Price, not the Price. The Holdover Price is a variable price and determined by Company in its sole discretion. The Holdover Price can be based on a variety of factors and is not solely driven by current and future market prices or risks. The Holdover Price can change without prior notice to Customer unless required by law. In some cases, the Holdover Price may vary significantly from the Price charged during the Initial Term of this Agreement. The following are some, but not all, of the material factors that can influence Company's determination of the initial Holdover Price and any subsequent changes to the Holdover Price: (i) the current and future expected prices for wholesale electric supply (including an analysis of the supply and demand factors affecting these prices, if desired) and Company desired risk premiums on any pricing; (ii) Company's supply position in the market and its comfort level with respect to those positions; (iii) Company's expected gross margin, target gross and profit margins, and desired revenues; (iv) Company's Customer counts and attrition; and/or (v) the prices charged by competitors and the Utility.

The Parties understand and agree that the RPS Charge is based on a REC and obligation costing allocation mechanism based on periodic estimates that will likely not reflect the final actual cost of such RECs and obligations, and the Parties agree to accept such risk. Company will determine the monthly RPS Charge in its sole discretion based on its thencurrent estimate of the cost of such RECs and obligations, and the published energy portfolio obligations, but such charges will be ongoing, and it shall not be required to provide a credit if the actual cost to purchase RECs and obligations for a month is less than the RPS Charge for such month. Company will determine, in its sole discretion, its strategy for purchasing RECs and obligations, including without limitation, the timing, frequency, volume, and actual price it pays for such RECs and obligations.
7. BILLING AND FEES. Each month, Customer shall pay the Company Electricity Charge. Unless the Parties agree in writing to alternate payment arrangements, Customer consents to be billed monthly for supply and any services provided hereunder through one of the following billing options, as permitted by law, at Company's discretion: (i) Customer will receive one bill from the Utility that includes the Company Electricity Charge, the Delivery Charges and applicable Taxes, (the "Consolidated Billing Option"); or (ii) Customer will receive two bills, one from Company for the Company Electricity Charge and one from the Utility for the Delivery Charges, each with applicable Taxes (the "Dual Billing Option"). Under the Consolidated Billing Option, Customer will make payments directly to the Utility pursuant to the applicable Utility tariff. Under the Dual Billing Option, Customer shall pay each Company bill within the number of days after the date of each such bill, as such number is set forth in the BEA. If, under the Consolidated Billing Option or

Dual Billing Option, any payment for the Company Electricity Charge made by Customer to Company or to the Utility is late under the applicable payment terms, Customer may be assessed the Late Fee and its delinquent balances may be reported to a credit agency. Further, in addition to any other rights of Company hereunder, if, during the Dual Billing Option, any payment for the Company Electricity Charge is late under the applicable payment terms, then Company shall have the right, without prior notice to the Customer, to convert all billing hereunder to the Consolidated Billing Option and convert the Price as necessary, on a commercial reasonable basis, to a fixed price sufficient to enable such Consolidated Billing.

Company may apply any credit balance on a particular Account to a balance owed on any other Customer Account. Further, Company has the right to set off any amounts owed by Company to Customer under this Agreement against any amounts owed by Customer to Company or its affiliates. Company may assess a twenty five dollar (\$25) fee against any transaction not processed due to insufficient funds or credit availability for any method of payment, including checks, bank drafts or credit card. If the Utility fails to timely obtain or transmit a meter reading, Company will issue or cause to be issued a bill to Customer based on its estimated Energy Usage and charges during the Billing Cycle. Company will include or cause to be included in any subsequent bill from Company, adjustments related to previous billings, including estimates, previous billing errors, meter read errors, or other errors or omissions. If one or more Pass-Through Charges are involved in deferred billing, Company has the right to estimate the Pass-Through Charges on the bills in the interim and Customer shall pay Company such estimated Pass-Through Charges. Customer's Energy Usage is determined for the applicable Settlement Interval as follows: IDR meters (interval meter data) are billed using the interval meter data provided by the Utility, (ii) scalar meters (non-interval meter data) are billed using the applicable load profile provided by the Utility to convert the actual meter read usage per unit provided by the Utility into interval usage data, and/or (iii) AMS meters are billed using the applicable load profile provided by the Utility until such time as the AMS meter read data is incorporated into the Company's billing system.
8. CREDIT AND DEPOSIT REQUIREMENTS. If Company determines, prior to offering service or at any time during the term of this Agreement, that Customer cannot demonstrate satisfactory creditworthiness, Customer has failed to timely pay all amounts due under this Agreement or there otherwise exists an Event of Default with respect to Customer under this Agreement, Company has the right to require Customer to either make advanced payments or provide to Company performance assurance to ensure prompt and timely payments of amounts due to Company under this Agreement. If, after Customer has been required to make advanced payments or provide performance assurance, Company determines that Customer's credit is unsatisfactory, Company has the right to require Customer to provide additional performance assurance. Customer shall post with Company any performance assurance within three (3) days after the date on which Company made a demand for initial or additional performance assurance. The amount and form of initial or additional performance assurance will be determined by Company in a commercially reasonable manner.

Company will not require an applicant to pay the balance due another TPS as a condition of establishing credit or providing competitive retail electric supply. Company will provide Customer a receipt for any cash deposit within fourteen (14) days after the date that such deposit has been received by Company. The posting or amount of any cash deposit is subject to any limitations imposed by applicable law. Cash deposits will be allocated only to Company Electricity Charges. Those held more than six (6) months will accrue interest after the date of receipt by Company at the rate of one percent ( $1 \%$ ) per annum. Such accrued interest will be applied annually to Customer's account. After termination of this Agreement, Company will apply any cash deposit, plus any unpaid accrued interest, toward any outstanding balance on Customer's final bill. Company will promptly refund any remaining cash deposit. Company's credit and deposit procedures TPS will comply with applicable BPU rules.
9. TERMINATION OF AGREEMENT. If Customer commits or is otherwise subject to an Event of Default in whole or with respect to one or more Accounts then, in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other remedy Company may have in law or equity, Company has the right to terminate this Agreement. Company has the right to terminate this Agreement in whole, or in part as to any affected Account(s), as determined solely by the Company. If the Agreement is so terminated by Company, Customer shall pay Company for all amounts owed up to the date of such termination including, without limitation, all electricity supplied, any other products and services provided to Customer through the date of such termination, and any applicable Late Fees. Further, Customer shall pay Company the sum of any Costs plus the greater of the Early Termination Fee or damages to Company. Such damages, if any, will be calculated based upon the value of the product of (i) the difference between the applicable Price(s) and the market price(s) for the same quantities of energy which would have been supplied hereunder for the remainder of the Initial Term, and (ii) the estimated Energy Usage by Customer, as determined by Company, during the remainder of the Initial Term. To determine "market prices," as used above, Company may consider, among other things, settlement prices of applicable

NYMEX futures contracts, quotations from leading dealers in energy swap contracts and other bona fide offers from parties participating in the wholesale and/or retail electricity markets, which may include affiliates of Company. In addition, if an Early Supply Switch occurs without Company receiving at least thirty (30) days' advance notice from Customer, Customer shall pay Company the Insufficient Notice Fee. Company will not be required to enter into any replacement transaction in order to determine Costs, the Early Termination Fee, market prices or damages. The Parties agree that the amounts recoverable hereunder are a reasonable estimate of loss and not a penalty.

Title and risk of loss to the electricity sold under this Agreement passes from Company to Customer when the electricity is delivered to the Delivery Point for each Account(s). Customer agrees that Company does not control the physical electricity sold under this Agreement, which electricity flows through the Utility transmission and/or delivery systems, and accordingly, Company shall not be responsible for any failure in the Utility transmission or delivery system.

In calculating each such charge, if the increase is not reasonably evident from the Change in Law itself, or if the charges subsequently increase based on another event, including, without limitation, a subsequent auction, Company may calculate the increase based on the charge incurred after the Change in Law event as compared to Company's earlier estimates of the charge.
