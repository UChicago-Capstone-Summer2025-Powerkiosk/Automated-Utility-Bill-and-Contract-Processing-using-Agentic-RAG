The image is a photo of a detailed table titled "Estimated Customer Usage Table (kWh)." It lists various accounts with columns for:

- No.

- Service Location Address
- Bill Type

- Anticipated End Date
- PLC as of 6/1/2019 (kW)
- PLC as of 6/1/2020 (kW)

Each row corresponds to a different account, with specific data for each column. The table is densely packed with numerical data, showing electricity usage in kilowatt-hours (kWh) for each month and a total for the year. The page is labeled "Page 2 of 8" at the bottom. The layout is structured with headers and data aligned in columns, and the overall design is clean and organized for readability.
