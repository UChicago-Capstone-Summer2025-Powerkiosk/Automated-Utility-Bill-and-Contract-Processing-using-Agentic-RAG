# Other Information 

This is an important message regarding a phone scam we have recently learned about. If you receive a call from a person claiming to be from FPL Energy Services or FPL and they are requesting immediate payment or your service will be shut off, do not give any information regarding your account or payment to the caller. Hang up the phone and contact us at 1-877-375-4674 or your local gas utility company to confirm your account status.

We are pleased to offer, at no cost, our monthly Natural Gas Advisor newsletter to help you further manage your energy costs. Please contact us at 1-877-375-4674 if you would like for us to enroll you in this helpful service.
