Current Charges for Electricity
![](images/img-0.jpeg)

The image is a photo/illustration of a section of an electricity bill. It includes a bar chart and some text.

- **Chart Type**: Bar chart
- **Axis Titles and Units**: The x-axis is labeled with dollar amounts ranging from $0 to $10.
- **Legend Entries and Data Points**:
  - "Supply $0.08" is indicated in blue, representing the cost of electricity from NEXTERA ENERGY SERVICES CONN.
  - "Delivery $6.46" is indicated in green, representing the cost to deliver electricity from Eversource.
- **Notable Styling**: The bar for delivery is prominently shown in green, extending to just past $6 on the x-axis, while the supply bar is much smaller, barely visible at the start of the x-axis.
- **Embedded Text**:
  - "Cost of electricity from NEXTERA ENERGY SERVICES CONN"
  - "Cost to deliver electricity from Eversource"
  - "Your electric supplier is NEXTERA ENERGY SERVICES CONN 20455 STATE HIGHWAY 249 HOUSTON TX 77070-2757 800-882-1276"
  - Handwritten notes: "Approved by", "Date approved", "Account #", "P.O. #", with handwritten entries "1/9/24" and "240777". There are also some initials or signatures.

The supply cost is minimal compared to the delivery cost, which is emphasized by the size of the green bar.

Important Messages About Your Account
Because the billing period spans a change in the rates, your usage has been calculated partly on the old rate and partly on the new rate.
