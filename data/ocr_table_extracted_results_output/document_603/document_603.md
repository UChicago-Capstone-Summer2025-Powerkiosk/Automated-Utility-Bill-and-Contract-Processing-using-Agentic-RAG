1. Agreement to Sell and Purchase Energy. This is an agreement between SmartestEnergy US LLC ("SEUS," the "Company," "Seller," "we," or "us"), an independent energy services company, and you ("Customer," "you," or "your") under which Customer authorizes SEUS to initiate electricity supply service and begin Customer's enrollment with SEUS (the "Agreement"). Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, SEUS agrees to sell and Customer agrees to purchase and accept all the electricity required to serve Customer's account(s) listed on Attachment A ("Purchase Quantities"). SEUS does not guarantee savings under this Agreement. Customer's local distribution utility(ies) (the "LDC") will continue to deliver the electricity supplied by SEUS and will be available to respond to outages and/or other emergencies. SEUS is not affiliated with and does not represent Customer's LDC.
2. Information Release Authorization. Customer authorizes SEUS to obtain and review information regarding Customer's credit history from credit reporting agencies and information from Customer's LDC, which shall include, but not be limited to the following: consumption history; billing determinants; account numbers; credit information; public assistance status; existence of medical emergencies; status as to whether Customer has a medical emergency, is human needs, elderly, blind or disabled; data applicable to cold weather periods; tax status; and eligibility for economic development or other incentives (collectively, "Customer Information"). This information may be used by SEUS to determine whether it will commence and/or continue to provide energy supply service to Customer and will not be disclosed to a third party unless required by law. Customer's execution of this Agreement shall constitute authorization for the release of this information to SEUS. SEUS reserves the right to refuse to provide service to Customer under this Agreement if it is unable to obtain the necessary Customer Information or it obtains Customer Information that it considers unsatisfactory. This authorization will remain in effect during any initial or renewal term of this Agreement; provided, however, that Customer may rescind this authorization at any time by providing written notice to SEUS or by calling SEUS at 1-800-544-0995. SEUS reserves the right to cancel this Agreement in the event Customer rescinds such authorization. The data obtained pursuant to this authorization will be retained by SEUS for a period of six years post-termination of this Agreement consistent with the statute of limitations for contractual disputes and may be used by SEUS in connection with any ongoing business or legal purpose with respect to its obligations under the Agreement, or to offer additional products or services to Customer during the Term or at any time in the six year period after the Agreement terminates, or as contained in any derivative work created by SEUS in association with its business as a retail energy provider.
3. Customer Acknowledgements. CUSTOMER ACKNOWLEDGES THE FOLLOWING: THAT ANY SALES REPRESENTATIVE WITH WHOM CUSTOMER HAS SPOKEN REPRESENTS SEUS, AND IS NOT FROM THE LDC; THAT YOU ARE THE CUSTOMER WHOSE NAME IS ON THE ACCOUNT, THE SPOUSE OF THE ACCOUNT HOLDER, OR OVER 18 AND AUTHORIZED TO MAKE DECISIONS CONCERNING THE ACCOUNT; THAT YOUR LDC WILL CONTINUE TO DELIVER YOUR

ELECTRICITY AND PROVIDE YOU WITH YOUR ELECTRICITY BILL UNLESS OTHERWISE AGREED TO IN WRITING; THAT YOU HAVE RECEIVED A COPY OF SEUS'S TERMS AND CONDITIONS, THE CONSUMER BILL OF RIGHTS, AND THE CUSTOMER DISCLOSURE STATEMENT; AND, IF A NON-RESIDENTIAL CUSTOMER, THAT YOU WERE INFORMED THAT THE LDC MAY DISCONNECT YOUR SERVICE AS A RESULT OF ANY FAILURE TO PAY SEUS'S CHARGES.
4. Term and Termination.
a. For all products except Variable. This Agreement will begin upon the date the parties executed this Agreement (the "Execution Date"). It will continue for the period set forth in the Customer Disclosure Statement (the "Term") from the first meter read date after the LDC processes the Customer's enrollment with SEUS (the "Start Date"). SEUS shall not be held responsible for any delays in the Start Date caused by the actions or inactions of the LDC. After the end of the Initial Term, this Agreement will automatically continue at a variable rate methodology unless and until this Agreement is terminated by either party. For Residential only: Not less than 30 days and no more than 60 days prior to the expiration of the Initial Term, SEUS will notify Customer in writing and/or by email of the switch to variable rate methodology at which SEUS will continue to serve Customer. Customer will have 15 days from Customer's receipt of such renewal notice to reject this offer and terminate the Agreement. If SEUS does not receive notice of Customer's termination of this Agreement, this Agreement will continue in full force and effect until canceled by Customer.
i. Variable Rate Methodology: After the Term, the rate for electricity will be a variable rate that may be higher or lower each month and will be set in SEUS's sole discretion. SEUS typically considers the following factors when setting variable rates:

- publically available competitor pricing;
- strategic business objectives;
- customer retention or attrition;
- market volatility or uncertainty;
- anticipated customer usage;
- the cost of procuring power including wholesale prices, ancillary service costs, capacity auctions, utility (LDC) fees, transmission and distribution losses, and storage costs;
- weather, supply congestion, and infrastructure issues;
- legal or regulatory issues; and
- profit margin.

This list of factors is not exhaustive and no single factor will determine the rate. Some factors must be estimated or projected and the factors SEUS considers may be weighed differently each month. SEUS may amortize sudden cost increases over multiple billing cycles so that its

customers do not bear the burden of such increases in a single month. For all of these reasons, the variable rate may not correlate with changes in wholesale market prices or your LDC's rates. In addition, the variable rate may be higher than your LDC rate or other suppliers' rates. For Residential and Small Business customers only, Your rate for the first month under a variable rate methodology will be set forth in the second notice sent by SEUS as set forth in the Customer Disclosure Statement. You may obtain the average monthly rates for the previous twenty four (24) months for SEUS's customers in your LDC's service territory who received service on a variable rate ("Historical Rates") by contacting SEUS. Please note that Historical Rates are not indicative of current or future rates.
b. Variable Service. This Agreement will begin on the date the parties executed this Agreement (the "Execution Date") and will continue unless and until this Agreement is terminated by either party. SEUS will begin supplying electricity to Customer on the first meter read date after the LDC processes the Customer's enrollment with SEUS (the "Start Date"). SEUS shall not be held responsible for any delays in the Start Date caused by the actions or inactions of the LDC.
c. Termination Fees. There are no early termination fees for Variable Service customers. For all other products, the projected amount of electricity to be consumed by customer for the remainder of the Term, multiplied by the difference between the contract price in effect for the remainder of the Term and the price at which SEUS can sell such electricity following the termination, or $\$ 500$ per account, whichever is greater. For all residential customers, the termination fee will be no greater than $\$ 100.00$ if there is less than 12 months left of the Term and $\$ 200.00$ if there is 12 months or more left of the Term. SEUS may terminate this agreement early for Customer fails to, i.) pay invoices timely ii.) provide performance assurance when requested, as provided in Sections 7 and 22, iii.) provide the notifications of behind the meter generation, net metering transactions or a state power allocation as required in Section 8, or iv.) provide credit support (if applicable) when due as specified in Attachment B or Section 23. If either Party terminates this Agreement early, then Customer shall owe an Early Termination Fee.
5. Price. The Price for all electricity under this Agreement shall be calculated as described in the Customer Disclosure Statement. For each billing cycle, the Price shall be applied to the Customer's metered usage for such billing cycle (as reported by the LDC).
6. Renewable Energy Products. This paragraph applies if Customer has chosen to receive a voluntary renewable energy product, as outlined in the Customer Disclosure Label. This product bundles electricity with Renewable Energy Certificates ("RECs") in an amount designed to match the Customer's usage. A REC represents the environmental benefits of 1 megawatt hour (MWh) of renewable energy that can be paired with electricity. This
product is Green-e ${ }^{\circledR}$ Energy certified and meets the environmental and consumer-protection standards set forth by the nonprofit Center for Resource Solutions. Learn more at www.green-e.org. Election of this product supports the development of renewable resources, but Customer understands and acknowledges that Customer may not actually be supplied with renewable energy.
7. Billing and Payment. At SEUS's option, Customer may receive a single bill for both commodity and delivery costs from either SEUS or the LDC ("Consolidated Bill"), or the LDC and SEUS may each invoice Customer separately ("Dual Bill"). SEUS will have the right to change the bill type one time during the term of this Agreement. Customer will pay SEUS for electric supply service based on meter readings and consumption information measured by and/or received from Customer's LDC ("Billing Quantity"). For invoices received from SEUS, Customer will pay each invoice in full within 20 days of the invoice date or be subject to a late payment charge of $1.5 \%$, or the highest percentage or amount allowable by law, per month. For invoices received from the LDC, Customer will pay each invoice in full as required by LDC's tariff or be subject to a late payment charge as required by LDC's tariff. If Customer fails to pay either any EDC invoice or any SEUS invoice when due, then, in addition to any other remedies that it may have, SEUS may terminate this Agreement upon 15 calendar days' written notice to Customer. Failure to make full payment of SEUS and LDC charges due on any Consolidated Bill will be grounds for disconnection of LDC services. Customer payments remitted in response to a Consolidated Bill shall be pro-rated (when so required) in accordance with procedures adopted by the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities ("BPU"). A $\$ 35$ fee will be charged for all returned payments. If any payments made by you directly to us are rejected two (2) times in a one-year period, the only form of payment acceptable will be a certified check, money order, or electronic funds transfer. If you make a payment for a lesser amount, which includes a statement or letter indicating that the lesser payment constitutes full payment, we may accept such payment without prejudice to any other rights or remedies that we may have against you and we may apply it to your account(s) as a partial payment.
8. Customer Usage Deviation and Behind the Meter Generation. If Customer's metered usage during any billing period exceeds, or falls below, its historic usage during a like billing period by $100 \%$ or more, and such variation results in SEUS incurring additional charges, Customer will be responsible for the payment of such additional charges. Customer agrees to inform SEUS of any existing self-generation unit(s), any net metering transactions or any state power allocations associated with the Customer accounts included in this Agreement prior to execution of this Agreement. If Customer fails to provide such notification, SEUS may change the Customer's price or terminate this Agreement. Subsequent to the execution of this Agreement, Customer agrees to promptly provide SEUS with advanced written notice once Customer decides to implement any of the following: (i) changes its use of self-generation unit(s), (ii) installation of additional selfgeneration unit(s); or (iii) addition or amendment of a net metering transaction or state power allocation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Customer shall reimburse SEUS for any costs incurred by SEUS as a result of Customer making any of the changes identified in this paragraph or increases in Customer's capacity or transmission tag due to reduced customer generation

output during a tag setting period. For the avoidance of doubt, consumption bandwidth thresholds established above shall not apply in a manner that would duplicate Customer's cost reimbursement obligations when calculating costs pursuant to this section..
9. Delivery Point, Title, and Taxes. All electricity sold pursuant to this Agreement shall be delivered to a location ("Delivery Point"), which shall constitute the point at which the sale occurs and title to the energy passes to you from us. Customer will be liable for and pay all taxes or surcharges, which are imposed with respect to the sale of electricity. If Customer is exempt from such taxes, Customer is responsible for identifying and requesting any exemption from the collection of the taxes by providing appropriate documentation to SEUS. Failure to provide appropriate documentation will result in Customer being charged tax until a completed form is on file and accepted by the LDC. Customer will also be responsible to arrange for any tax refunds directly with the state taxing authority.
10. Emergency Services. The LDC will continue to respond to emergencies. In the event of an electricity emergency or service interruption, contact your LDC at one of the telephone numbers listed below. You should also contact your local emergency personnel.

11. Termination. Customer acknowledges that in the event of a cancellation or termination of this Agreement, it may take several billing cycles for Customer to return to the LDC for commodity supply service. Customer remains liable for all SEUS charges until Customer's switch to the LDC or another supplier is effective. For residential customers: Customer will not be liable for any early termination fees in the event Customer: (i) relocates within or outside of the LDC's service territory; (ii) suffers a disability that renders Customer unable to pay for SEUS's services; or (iii) dies, A final bill will be rendered within 45 days after the final scheduled meter reading by the LDC or if access is unavailable, an estimate of usage will be used in lieu of the final bill, which will be trued-up when the final meter reading is provided.
