## Important definitions

Rotating outage blocks are subject to change without advance notice due to operational conditions.
Tier 1/Baseline allowance: Some residential rates are given a Tier 1/Baseline allowance - a CPUC approved percentage of average customer usage during summer and winter months. Your Tier 1/Baseline allowance provides for basic needs at an affordable price and encourages conservation. Your allowance is assigned based on the climate where you live, the season and your heat source. As you use more energy, you pay more for usage. Any usage over your baseline allowance will be charged at a higher price.
Wildfire Fund Charge: Charge on behalf of the State of California Department of Water Resources (DWR) to fund the California Wildfire Fund. For usage prior to October 1, 2020, this charge included costs related to the 2001 California energy crisis, also collected on behalf of the DWR. These charges belong to DWR, not PG\&E.

About San José Clean Energy (SJCE)
San José Clean Energy is a program of the City of San José and provides its residents and businesses with electricity from sources like solar, wind, and hydropower. SJCE offers the additional benefits of customer choice, community programs, local control, transparency, and accountability.

About San José Clean Energy (SJCE)
San José Clean Energy is a program of the City of San José and provides its residents and businesses with electricity from sources like solar, wind, and hydropower. SJCE offers the additional benefits of customer choice, community programs, local control, transparency, and accountability.

SJ Cares is SJCE's program that allows customers enrolled in CARE or FERA financial assistance programs to receive cleaner energy at the lowest possible rates. Learn more: www.SanJoseCleanEnergy.org/Discount-Pro grams.

About San José Clean Energy (SJCE)
San José Clean Energy is a program of the City of San José and provides its residents and businesses with electricity from sources like solar, wind, and hydropower. SJCE offers the additional benefits of customer choice, community programs, local control, transparency, and accountability.

SJCE's standard electricity generation service, GreenSource, provides customers with more renewable power. SJCE also offers a 100\% renewable product, TotalGreen, for a small premium. Learn more.
www.SanJoseCleanEnergy.org/TotalGreen.

## Understanding SJCE Charges

SJCE replaces PG\&E Generation Charges. PG\&E continues to provide all electric delivery, billing, and gas services. Under PG\&E Electric Delivery Charges, note the Generation Credit. This is what PG\&E would have charged for power, and now credits back to you. The PG\&E Power Charge Indifference Adjustment and Franchise Fee are factored into SJCE's rate-setting. Learn more.
www.SanJoseCleanEnergy.org/Understandin g-Your-Bill.

SJ Cares is SJCE's program that allows customers enrolled in CARE or FERA financial assistance programs to receive cleaner energy at the lowest possible rates. Learn more: www.SanJoseCleanEnergy.org/Discount-Pro grams.

Please pay your SJCE charges directly to PG\&E (see page 1 of this bill). Do not send payment to San José Clean Energy.
