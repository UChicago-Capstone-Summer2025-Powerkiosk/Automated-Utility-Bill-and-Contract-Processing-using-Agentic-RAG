(Solutions/Key Accounts GTC v.05.02.19)

This Master Energy Purchase Agreement - Electric Commodity Sales, which comprises the below General Terms and Conditions (the "General Terms and Conditions") dated and effective as of 05/26/2020 and all schedules, attachments, riders, and exhibits hereto, including any Attachment A-1 (each, an "Attachment" and collectively, this "Agreement"), is entered into by and between AEP Energy, Inc. ("AEP Energy") and Mather Lifeways ("Customer") (each of AEP Energy and Customer referred to individually as a "Party" and collectively as the "Parties") and is intended to govern the purchase and sale of Retail Energy (as hereinafter defined) between the Parties for Customer's account(s) (which may include non-metered lighting accounts) specified on any Attachment (each, a "Service Location").

## General Terms and Conditions

## I. PURCHASE AND SALE OF RETAIL ENERGY

During the relevant Term (as hereinafter defined) and unless excused by a Force Majeure, AEP Energy shall sell to Customer the commodity portion of its retail electric requirements at each Service Location, and Customer shall exclusively purchase from AEP Energy and take delivery of, all of its retail electric generation supply requirements at each such Service Location (the "Retail Energy"), the terms and conditions of which are described in the relevant Attachment(s). The Retail Energy shall be provided to Customer's relevant electric distribution company (each as specified in the relevant Attachment, the "EDC") and transmission system interconnection point (each, a "Delivery Point"). The EDC is responsible for delivery of the Retail Energy to any Service Location at and from the Delivery Point, as well as for reading Customer's meter and responding to emergencies. The delivery and metering of the Retail Energy is subject to the applicable terms and conditions of the EDC. Customer designates AEP Energy as an authorized recipient of Customer's account, billing, and historical and ongoing usage information and consents to the disclosure by the EDC to AEP Energy of certain basic information about Customer and each Service Location, including: account number, meter number, meter read data, rate class, billing and payment information, account name, service address, billing address, and telephone number. Customer is solely responsible for payment of all charges or costs related to the EDC's delivery or distribution of the Retail Energy to Customer and other services, whether billed to AEP Energy or Customer, including any switching, telecommunications, and/or meter or meter reading related costs.
The Retail Energy pricing specified in any Attachment is determined by AEP Energy using Customer's actual and estimated historical and forecasted load data, which is considered representative of each Service Location's anticipated Retail Energy requirements for the Term, and applies to all Retail Energy covered under the relevant Attachment, including any unmetered lighting volumes. With respect to any pricing, or a factor of the pricing, in any Attachment based (in whole or part) upon a specified index, any such reference, publication (in whole or part), or entity responsible for the publication of the price source includes any successor thereto.

## II. BILLING AND PAYMENT

A. General Billing and Payment Terms: AEP Energy or the relevant EDC shall provide monthly invoices related to the sold Retail Energy, based on the relevant EDC's meter read cycle, in accordance with the billing method specified in the relevant Attachment, (1) as a single bill through utility/EDC consolidated billing (UCB), (2) through supplier consolidated billing (SCB), or (3)
as a separate bill from each of AEP Energy and the relevant EDC (Dual Bill); provided, however, the relevant EDC may convert or alter the invoicing method from time to time as it so requires. AEP Energy will send SCB or Dual Bill invoices via the first available method (listed in order of priority): (1) the billing email address stated in the "Customer Information" table at the end of these General Terms and Conditions (unless Customer requests paper bills) or later specified by Customer in writing (including email), (2) the billing mailing address stated in such table or later specified by Customer in writing (including email), or (3) the physical address of any Service Location. AEP Energy may itemize or summarize invoices according to the various cost components (e.g., capacity or transmission) related to the Retail Energy and shall provide all further reasonable billing detail to Customer upon request. AEP Energy has the right to estimate bills in cases where actual billing determinants are unavailable. In cases where estimated bills are issued, AEP Energy shall subsequently reconcile the actual bill(s) and the estimated bill(s) and post any debit or credit amount to Customer's account. Customer shall pay all amounts due according to the instructions on the relevant invoice by payment in check or wire transfer of immediately available funds or via Automated Clearinghouse, such that AEP Energy will have received such payment not later than the close of business on the business day following the number of calendar days specified in the relevant Attachment from the date of the invoice containing the relevant charges. Late payments with respect to any and all amounts due and payable to AEP Energy (including any outstanding late payment charges and Settlement Amount(s) (as hereinafter defined), collectively, "Account Charges") shall incur interest charges at a rate of interest equal to one and one-half percent ( $1.5 \%$ ) per month or the maximum allowed under applicable law, whichever is less, and continue to accrue until all such amounts are paid in full. In any instance where any payment is declined by the issuing institution, Customer shall be assessed a charge of fortyfive dollars ( $\$ 45$ ) or the maximum allowed under applicable law (whichever is less) per declined payment. Customer shall be liable for all costs incurred by AEP Energy, including attorneys' fees, in connection with collection and enforcement of its rights on past due Account Charges.
B. Invoice Disputes and Adjustments: Customer may, in good faith, dispute in writing the correctness of any invoice rendered under this Agreement with respect to amounts due to AEP Energy by (1) delivering to AEP Energy written notice of the dispute, which must include the amount of, and reasonably sufficient basis for, the disputed amount and all reasonable supporting documentation (the "Notice of Dispute") and (2) making payment of the undisputed portion of the invoice within the normal terms, prior to the due date of the relevant invoice. During the forty-five (45) calendar days following AEP Energy's receipt of any Notice of Dispute (the "Dispute Period"), the Parties shall expeditiously and in good faith negotiate to resolve any disputed invoice. If the Parties are unable to mutually resolve in writing such dispute before expiration of the Dispute Period, either Party may exercise any remedy available to it at law or in equity pursuant to this Agreement. Customer must dispute charges strictly in accordance with the terms of this paragraph or it will be deemed to have waived its rights to dispute such charges. AEP Energy may at any time adjust and re-issue any previously-issued invoice to reflect Customer's actual usage and charges during the billing period covered therein, irrespective of whether Customer had previously paid the previously-issued invoice, and Customer will receive credit in such re-issued invoices

for any amount of the previously-issued invoice that had been paid by Customer.

## III. TAXES

Each Party shall pay or cause to be paid all taxes, fees, levies, penalties, licenses, or charges imposed by any governmental entity or agency having jurisdiction associated with the Retail Energy on its side of the relevant Delivery Point (including as enacted after the date hereof, "Taxes"). Any Party claiming entitlement to exemption from any Taxes or charges shall be responsible (A) to furnish timely to the other Party any necessary supporting documentation and (B) for associated interest, penalties, and/or Taxes from which exemption could not be documented due to any failure to do so.

## IV. TERM AND EFFECT OF TERMINATION

Should the Parties reach agreement regarding a Retail Energy purchase and sale transaction under this Agreement, the Parties shall execute an Attachment, which will include, as applicable: (A) the identification of Service Location(s), (B) the term, (C) Retail Energy pricing and related provisions, (D) delivery quantity, and (E) other special terms and conditions, if any. This Agreement is effective as of the date hereof, and will remain in effect for so long as any Attachment remains outstanding or, if applicable, until the conclusion of any Holdover Term (as hereinafter defined) (the "Term"). The Parties agree that the EDC determines when Customer will be switched to AEP Energy for its Retail Energy supply, and that such switch will occur in accordance with the EDC's rules and practices regarding such switching. AEP Energy, therefore, shall use commercially reasonable efforts to begin supplying Retail Energy to Customer under the relevant Attachment (1) on the available enrollment date that is established by the EDC and estimated to be on or around the Anticipated Start Date specified in the relevant Attachment, and (2) after AEP Energy receives confirmation that the EDC has accepted the delivery service request (the "Commencement Date"); provided, however, that in no event shall the Commencement Date be fewer than three (3) calendar days following execution of the relevant Attachment. AEP Energy shall not be liable for any lost savings or lost opportunity as a result of any delay in any Commencement Date.
Following termination or expiration of the relevant Term, AEP Energy may continue to supply Retail Energy under this Agreement to any Service Location on a month-to-month holdover basis (each, a "Holdover Term"). The price payable during any Holdover Term shall be the applicable Regional Transmission Organization ("RTO") EDC day ahead hourly locational marginal price (LMP) plus an adder of $\$ 0.005$ per kWh , and any and all applicable bypassable costs, charges, and fees for capacity, transmission, line losses, ancillary services, renewable portfolio standards (RPS), taxes, and any other related penalties, fees, charges, expenses, and other costs to serve incurred by AEP Energy of every kind and nature shall be passed through in a commercially reasonable manner to Customer with no additional mark-up. In cases where Customer's EDC does not provide interval usage data, AEP Energy shall, using commercially reasonable methodologies, estimate the load weighted average of the applicable LMP. Either Party may at any time terminate the Holdover Term and return any Service Location to the EDC without penalty or prejudice.
In the event of termination as provided in this Agreement, all further obligations of the Parties under this Agreement shall terminate without further liability of the Parties, except for the payment by the owing Party of any sums due and owing to the other Party related to performance delivered prior to termination, whether or not then invoiced, including any further Account Charges. Any other obligation or agreement hereunder which by its nature survives, shall survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement, including the Parties' respective agreements and obligations under the "Confidentiality," "Title, Indemnification, Warranty, and Limitation of Liability," and "Governing Law, Venue, and Waiver of

Jury Trial" sections, and shall apply whether in contract, equity, tort, or otherwise. Such termination shall, with respect to each Service Location, be effective on the next available drop date as established by the EDC. In the event that the EDC's retail electric supply choice program is terminated or materially changed in any manner prior to the end of the Term, AEP Energy may terminate the relevant Attachment(s), or, if applicable, this Agreement, without penalty to either Party.

## V. CREDIT

Each Party represents that there is no bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, or other similar proceeding pending or being contemplated by it or, to its knowledge, threatened against it. Customer agrees to provide commercially reasonable credit information upon request. Should the creditworthiness or financial responsibility of Customer become unsatisfactory to AEP Energy at any time during the Term, as determined by AEP Energy in its commercially reasonable discretion, AEP Energy may request additional credit information, including financial statements in accordance with the previous sentence, and in addition thereto, require that Customer deliver to AEP Energy, as security, adequate assurance of performance, including credit support in such form and amount as AEP Energy may in its discretion require, including a parental guaranty or letter of credit from a creditworthy entity in each case acceptable to AEP Energy, deposit, or prepayment ("Adequate Assurance of Performance"). Upon receipt of such request from AEP Energy, Customer shall have five (5) business days to provide the requested information and/or Adequate Assurance of Performance to AEP Energy.

## VI. EVENTS OF DEFAULT

A. Definition: An "Event of Default" shall mean, with respect to the Party to which the following applies (the "Defaulting Party"), the occurrence of any of the following: (1) the failure of such Party to make, when due, any payment required pursuant to this Agreement if such failure is not remedied within three (3) business days after written notice and demand for payment; (2) any representation or warranty made by such Party herein being false or misleading in any material respect when made or ceases to remain true (and which (if capable of being excused or remedied) is not remedied within fifteen (15) calendar days after written notice) during any Term; (3) the failure of such Party to perform any material covenant or obligation set forth in this Agreement, including any unexcused failure to deliver or take any quantity of Retail Energy under this Agreement, and such failure is not excused pursuant to Force Majeure (as hereinafter defined) or remedied within fifteen (15) calendar days after written notice; (4) either Party, or the entity providing Adequate Assurance of Performance, disaffirms, disclaims, repudiates, or rejects, in whole or in part, or challenges the validity of, this Agreement, any Attachment or transaction entered into pursuant to this Agreement, or any Adequate Assurance of Performance issued in connection with this Agreement; (5) AEP Energy's receipt of notice from any EDC or Customer of Customer's effective or intended termination of supply with AEP Energy at any Service Location prior to the end of the term of the relevant Attachment; (6) Customer (A) files a petition or otherwise commences, authorizes, or acquiesces in the commencement of a proceeding or cause of action under any bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, or similar law, or has any such petition filed or proceeding commenced against it, (B) makes an assignment or any general arrangement for the benefit of creditors, (C) otherwise becomes bankrupt or insolvent (however evidenced), or (D) has a liquidator, administrator, receiver, trustee, conservator, or similar official appointed with respect to it or any portion of its property or assets, regardless of whether such appointment is made in connection with a bankruptcy proceeding or reorganization for the benefit of creditors; (7) the occurrence of any event of default with respect to Customer under any other

agreement between the Parties, including any Master Energy Purchase Agreement - Natural Gas Commodity Sales, NAESB Base Contract for Sale and Purchase of Natural Gas, or other agreement for, or in support of, the purchase and sale of retail energy; or (8) the failure of Customer to deliver requested information and/or to deliver, and/or cause to be delivered, Adequate Assurance of Performance or otherwise satisfy the creditworthiness requirements under the "Credit" section.
B. Suspension and Early Termination: If an Event of Default occurs, the Party that is not the Defaulting Party (the "NonDefaulting Party") may, at its option and in its sole discretion, take any one or more of the following actions: (1) suspend its performance under this Agreement; (2) terminate this Agreement (including any or all Attachments hereunder) by sending written notice to the Defaulting Party; or (3) exercise such other rights and remedies as may be available to it at low or in equity pursuant to this Agreement. In the event of such suspension or an early termination, Customer shall pay to AEP Energy all amounts owed under this Agreement, including amounts owed for delivered performance, whether or not then invoiced. In the event of such an early termination, (i) AEP Energy shall return the relevant Service Location(s) to the EDC effective on the next available drop date as established by such EDC and (ii) the Defaulting Party shall also pay to the Non-Defaulting Party as liquidated damages a termination payment amount (the "Settlement Amount") equal to (a) Contract Value minus Wholesale Market Value (if Customer is the Defaulting Party) or (b) Retail Market Value minus Contract Value (if AEP Energy is the Defaulting Party); provided, however, that no such Settlement Amount shall be due to a Party under this section if such Party is the Defaulting Party.
As used herein, the following terms shall have the following meanings:
"Contract Value" means the amount that would have been owed by Customer related to the Remaining Performance (as hereinafter defined) pursuant to the applicable Attachment(s).
"Retail Market Value" means what Customer is actually paying, so long as no more than is commercially reasonable, related to the Remaining Performance.
"Remaining Performance" means the amount of Retail Energy expected to be supplied by AEP Energy during the remainder of the relevant Term had it not been terminated early.
"Wholesale Market Value" means the value that AEP Energy accrues in reallocating, terminating, or liquidating any portion of any energy supply contract, hedge, or related trading position or arrangement held by or for AEP Energy, or in avoiding any cost, in the case of any cost component (e.g., capacity or transmission), related to the Remaining Performance. For the avoidance of doubt, AEP Energy shall not be required to enter into a replacement transaction(s) in order to determine the Wholesale Market Value.
The Non-Defaulting Party shall calculate the Settlement Amount in its commercially reasonable discretion, including, where applicable, its estimates of market prices and forward market prices. Such Settlement Amount calculation shall be made available to the Defaulting Party upon written request. The Settlement Amount shall be paid by the Defaulting Party to the Non-Defaulting Party within five (5) business days after notice of the Settlement Amount due and owing to the Non-Defaulting Party. The Parties acknowledge and agree that the Settlement Amount constitutes a reasonable approximation of harm or loss, is a fair and reasonable method of estimating damages that a Party will suffer or incur in such a case in the light of the anticipated or actual harm caused by the termination or suspension, the difficulties of proof of loss, and the inconvenience or non-feasibility of otherwise obtaining an adequate remedy, and is not a penalty or punitive in any respect but is reasonable compensation for a Party's damages.
VII. SERVICE LOCATION CLOSURE

Confidential - Solutions/Key Accounts GTC v.05.02.19
Customer shall provide AEP Energy at least thirty (30) calendar days' prior written notice prior to terminating supply at any Service Location, including as a result of ceasing operations at such Service Location, closing any Service Location, or the sale of any Service Location to an unrelated third party. Customer shall be responsible for payment of damages incurred by AEP Energy, if any, relating to or arising from any such termination of supply. Such damages shall be calculated in the same manner as the Settlement Amount as if Customer is the Defaulting Party. The Parties acknowledge and agree that the pricing included in the relevant Attachment reflects, among other factors, Customer's expected usage and EDC-specific pricing under such Attachment. In the event that Customer does not pay AEP Energy for related damages owed in accordance with this section, AEP Energy reserves the right to adjust, in its commercially reasonable discretion, the pricing for any remaining Service Location(s) based on the remaining estimated usage. The Parties' obligations under this Agreement will continue in full force and effect for any remaining Service Location(s) on the relevant Attachment.

## VIII. RELATIONSHIP OF PARTIES

The relationship between the Parties is that of independent contractors for the sale and purchase of Retail Energy, and nothing in this Agreement establishes a joint venture, fiduciary relationship, partnership, other joint undertaking, or any other relationship or imposes a trust or partnership duty, obligation, or liability on either Party. Customer acknowledges that, other than those representations contained in this Agreement, it has not relied on any representation, communication (written or oral), or omission by AEP Energy in entering into this Agreement or any Attachment, including in evaluating the advantages or disadvantages of any specific product or service or predictions about savings, future energy prices, or any other matter. Customer acknowledges that the EDC's standard offer service rates generally change from time to time and therefore AEP Energy does not provide any guarantee of savings in comparison to the EDC's standard offer service rates. If Customer received price comparison(s) in connection with this Agreement, by entry into this Agreement, Customer understands and agrees that it has been informed, prior to its entry into this Agreement, that no guarantee of savings is being provided. If a property management company or agent ("Agent") is acting and executing on behalf of the owner of any Service Location (the "Owner"), Agent represents and warrants that it has the full and complete authority to execute and bind the Owner to this Agreement and that the term of such granted authority from the Owner does not expire or terminate prior to the end of the Term.

## IX. ASSIGNMENT

## X. FORCE MAJEURE

Neither Party shall be required to perform or fulfill its obligations (other than such Party's obligation to make payment(s) then due or becoming due with respect to delivered performance prior to a Force Majeure) under this Agreement so long as and to the extent a Party (the "Claiming Party") is prevented by Force Majeure from carrying out, in whole or part, its obligations under this Agreement and such Claiming Party gives notice to the other Party as soon as practicable after it has actual, or reasonably should have had constructive, knowledge of such Force Majeure. "Force Majeure" shall mean an event or circumstance that (A) prevents the Claiming Party from performing its obligations; (B) cannot be reasonably overcome or avoided; (C) is beyond the Claiming Party's reasonable control; and (D) does not result from the Claiming Party's fault, negligence, or particular economic circumstances, including, to the extent satisfying the foregoing requirements, acts of God, landslides; lightning, fire; storms or storm warnings; flood; weather related events affecting an entire geographic region, such as low temperatures that cause failure of transmission or distribution systems; terrorism; sabotage; breach by the EDC; electric grid interruption and/or curtailment; earthquake; war; riot or other civil unrest; or requirements, actions, or failure to act on the part of governmental authorities, including actions such as necessity for compliance with any court order, law, statute, ordinance, regulation, or policy having the effect of law promulgated by a governmental authority having jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the foregoing in this section, in no event will Force Majeure be, or will the applicable Party's performance be excused, based on economic hardship of either Party, including a Party's ability to purchase or sell, as applicable. Retail Energy at a price more advantageous than the price under the relevant Attachment, or with respect to Customer, the loss or failure of Customer's facilities or Customer's inability to use Retail Energy purchased hereunder. If the Force Majeure continues for a period in excess of thirty (30) calendar days, then the non-Claiming Party may terminate this Agreement by providing the other Party written notice of the early termination, without such termination constituting an Event of Default.

## XI. REGULATORY EVENT

In the event that any new, or any change in any existing, law, statute, rule, regulation, order, decision (including any judgment or judicial decision), decree, tariff, charge, or rate class, or process, practice, procedure, protocol, design, or structure, or other event, including any change in any formula rate calculation or charge (e.g., any increase in the rate for network integration transmission service or capacity by the EDC, RTO, or Independent System Operator (ISO), as applicable), or any change in any interpretation or application of any of the foregoing, by any governmental authority, court, EDC, ISO, RTO, or other regulated service provider alters to the detriment of AEP Energy its costs to perform or its economic returns under this Agreement (a "Regulatory Event"), AEP Energy may pass through such cost or economic effect to Customer to eliminate the impact of such Regulatory Event, and all other terms and conditions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.
