# COLORADO'S DIVERSE ENERGY MIX 

![](images/img-4.jpeg)

The image is a photo of a wind turbine blade against a clear blue sky. The focus is on the turbine's hub and a portion of the blades, highlighting the structure and design of the wind turbine. The image captures the turbine from a low angle, emphasizing its size and the clean energy aspect associated with wind power.

Power delivery: Includes specific labor associated with transmission and distribution facilities, metering, billing, customer service, allocated overheads, taxes and a profit component.
Power supply: Costs include all purchased power and energy source costs. For generation plants owned by Xcel Energy, power supply costs also include labor at generation plants, depreciation of generation plants, allocated overhead, taxes and a profit component.
Price components: Percentage components for an average monthly electric bill:
![](images/img-5.jpeg)

The image is a graph/chart, specifically a pair of donut charts comparing the percentage components of power delivery and power supply for residential and commercial services.

- **Residential service:**
  - Power delivery: 37%
  - Power supply: 63%

- **Commercial service:**
  - Power delivery: 40%
  - Power supply: 60%

The chart uses two colors to differentiate between "Power delivery" and "Power supply," with labels indicating "Transmission and delivery" for power delivery and "Generation and purchase" for power supply.

Example: If your residential bill for this month is $\$ 67.10$, then about $63 \%$ (or $\$ 42.34$ of your bill) is for the electricity itself, and about $37 \%$ (or $\$ 24.76$ ) covers the cost of having the electricity delivered to your home.
Note: Price component information applies to the average customer and may differ when applied to individual customers. Additional information is available upon request.

Power supply mix: Our Colorado energy mix includes coal, natural gas, wind, solar and hydroelectric power. Energy sources used in power generation and purchase for all energy customers in the 2019 calendar year:

2019 Energy Mix, Colorado
