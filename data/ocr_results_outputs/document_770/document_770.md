This bill reflects a BPU-approved change in the Supply portion of your electric bill effective on and after September 1, 2023. The increase in the Supply portion of your bill is due to a change in the Transmission rate. The overall impact for business customers will vary by individual customer usage. Tariff information may also be found by visiting pseg.com.

The image is a bar and line chart showing a yearly usage breakdown (monthly-based) of electricity from September 2022 to September 2023. 

- **Chart Type**: Bar and line chart
- **X-Axis**: Months from "Sep 2022" to "Sep 2023"
- **Y-Axis (Left)**: Energy usage in kWh, ranging from 0 to 9500
- **Y-Axis (Right)**: Not explicitly labeled but corresponds to the line graph
- **Legend**:
  - Orange bars represent "Total energy used"
  - A thin line represents "Highest Measured Demand each month"
  - "E" indicates "Estimated reading"
- **Data Points**: 
  - Each month has an orange bar indicating the total energy used.
  - A line runs across the chart indicating the highest measured demand each month.
- **Styling**: 
  - The bars are orange.
  - The line is a thin, possibly gray line.
  - The chart includes estimated readings marked with "E".

## MEASURED DEMAND

Demand kW
15.60

Measured Demand is the maximum use of electricity at any time during a monthly time period, as measured by your meter.

## BILLED DEMAND

Annual Demand kW
15.60

Summer Demand kW
15.60

## SUPPLY CAPACITY

Generation kW
17.092

Transmission kW
15.438

Supply capacity is required to serve the system's annual peak usage. It represents your share of these facilities, in kilowatts (kW).
