provided to Customers who elect to receive their bills electronically through the Company's Online Bill-Pay Program.
Outage Credit : A credit issued by the company in case of a prolonged electric service outage.

## Charges

Charges for electric or gas service are based on rates or prices approved by the New York State Public Service Commission (PSC). When changes in prices are approved by the PSC, information will be included with your bill. Complete price schedules are available on our website or by contacting us. National Grid reserves the right to upwardly adjust a previously issued bill or back bill.
Basic Service: A charge to cover costs for meter reading, billing, equipment and maintenance. This charge is the same regardless of how much energy is used during the billing period.
Tariff Surcharge: New York State and many local municipalities impose taxes on National Grid's revenue. These operating costs are recovered through a tariff surcharge applied to all rates and charges and may vary among taxing municipalities within the National Grid system area.
Sales Tax: In some areas National Grid is required to collect state and local sales taxes. Some school districts also impose taxes.
Merchant Function Charge: A charge for the Company's cost to procure gas or electricity supply. The Company will not bill you this charge if you choose an alternate supplier.

## Energy Measurement Terms

kWh: The unit of electricity usage measured by your meter. One kilowatt-hour(kWh) is 1000 watts-hours, and will light a 100-watt bulb for 10 hours. The number of kWhs is used to determine the electricity charges on your bill.
Meter Multiplier: Due to their design, some meters record a fraction of the total usage. The multiplier is used to convert the recorded meter reading on these types of meters to total actual consumption. CCF: The unit of gas volume ( 100 cubic feet) as measured by your meter.
Therm: A unit of heat content equal to 100,000 British Thermal Units (BTU). A BTU represents the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The number of CCFs is multiplied by a conversion factor to determine the therms used. The number of therms is used to determine the gas charges on your bill.

## Estimating Your Usage

When we are unable to obtain a reading, we estimate your usage based on your past usage, taking current weather conditions into account. Because our meters keep a continuous record of usage, any difference between estimated and actual usage is reconciled with the next meter reading. To avoid estimated readings, you can take your own reading on or just before the scheduled date shown on your bill and call it in at 1-888-932-0301.
For more information, visit us at: www.nationalgrid .com or call 1-800-642-4272. Customers with problems paying their National Grid bill should call 1-800-443-1837.
