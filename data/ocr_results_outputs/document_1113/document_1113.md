Tougher Penalties Help Protect Utility Workers: Our field workers often face a number of challenges while performing their duties, but New York State has new laws in place to help better protect them. Now, any action by a member of the public that prevents a utility worker from performing their job, or causes the worker physical injury, is considered a felony.
