Thank you for your payment.
Duke Energy does not maintain customers' natural gas piping after or downstream of the meter. You should maintain such piping by periodically inspecting for leaks. If the piping is metal, you should also check for signs of corrosion. You should repair such piping if leaks or corrosion are discovered. For assistance locating, inspecting or repairing buried piping, please contact a licensed heating/plumbing contractor. You should always call 811 prior to digging. Once your lines are marked, always dig by hand if digging near natural gas piping.

Mail your payment at least 7 days before the due date or pay instantly at duke-energy.com/billing. Late payments are subject to a $1.5 \%$ late charge.

Please return this portion with your payment. Thank you for your business.

## Important to know

## Your next meter reading: Dec 29

Please be sure we can safely access your meter for actual readings. Don't worry if your digital meter flashes eights from time to time. That's a normal part of the energy measuring process.

## Your electric service may be disconnected if your payment is past due

If payment for your electric service is past due, we may begin disconnection procedures. If your service is disconnected because of a missed payment, you must pay the amount specified in the Important Disconnect Information section on your bill, as well as, a reconnection fee, before your service will be reconnected. The reconnection fee is $\$ 10$ for electric service that may be reconnected remotely, $\$ 69$ for electric service that is not eligible to be reconnected remotely, and $\$ 17$ for gas service. In such situations where both electric and gas service are disconnected for non-payment, the reconnection fee will not exceed $\$ 27$ for both.

## Failure to pay may result in a return to our standard offer for generation

Failure to pay charges for a competitive retail service may result in cancellation of your contract with the respective retail electric supplier. You will then be returned to Duke Energy Ohio's standard offer for generation services.

## Questions or complaints

If you have a question or complaint about your bill or service, please contact us via one of the contact options provided.

If your complaint is not resolved after contacting Duke Energy or if you need general utility information, please contact the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO) or the Ohio Consumers' Counsel (OCC) via one of the contacts provided.
