- "Estimated Outdoor Usage (kWh)"
- Months listed from Jan to Dec.
- Data for each month, e.g., Jan: 1,620.50, Feb: 1,456.50, Mar: 1,620.50, etc.
- Total: 17,730.00
- "Account Number"
- "Service Address"
- "AEP Energy"
- "Estimated Outdoor Usage" is repeated in the table.
- "kWh" is used as a unit for measurement.
- The table is oriented vertically with the months listed in a column.

The table appears to show a yearly usage breakdown (monthly-based) of energy consumption in kilowatt-hours (kWh).
