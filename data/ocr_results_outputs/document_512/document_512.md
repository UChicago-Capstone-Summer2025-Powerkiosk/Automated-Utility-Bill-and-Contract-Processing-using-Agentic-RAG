## Important definitions

Rotating outage blocks are subject to change without advance notice due to operational conditions.
Demand charge: Many non-residential rates include a demand charge. Demand is a measurement of the highest usage of electricity in any single fifteen (or sometimes five) minute period during a monthly billing cycle. Demand is measured in kilowatts (or kW). High demand is usually associated with equipment start-up. By spreading equipment start-ups over a longer period of time, you may be able to lower demand and reduce your demand charges.
Time-of-use electric prices are higher every day during afternoons and evenings, and lower at other times of the day. Prices also change by season, with higher prices in the summer and lower prices in the winter.
Wildfire Fund Charge: Charge on behalf of the State of California Department of Water Resources (DWR) to fund the California Wildfire Fund. For usage prior to October 1, 2020, this charge included costs related to the 2001 California energy crisis, also collected on behalf of the DWR. These charges belong to DWR, not PG\&E.

Dich vu khách tiếng Việt (Vietnamese) 1-800-298-8438
Business Customer Service 1-800-468-4743

Power Charge Indifference Adjustment (PCIA): The PCIA is a charge to ensure that both PG\&E customers and those who have left PG\&E service to purchase electricity from other providers pay for the above market costs for electric generation resources that were procured by PG\&E on their behalf. 'Above market' refers to the difference between what the utility pays for electric generation and current market prices for the sale of those resources. Visit www.pge.com/cca.
Wildfire Hardening Charge: PG\&E has been permitted to issue bonds that enable it to recover more quickly certain costs related to preventing and mitigating catastrophic wildfires, while reducing the total cost to its customers. Your bill for electric service includes a fixed recovery charge called the Wildfire Hardening Charge that has been approved by the CPUC to repay those bonds. The right to recover the Wildfire Hardening Charge has been transferred to a separate entity (called the Special Purpose Entity) that issued the bonds and does not belong to PG\&E. PG\&E is collecting the Wildfire Hardening Charge on behalf of the Special Purpose Entity. For details visit: www.pge.com/tariffs/assets/pdf/tariffbook/ELEC_PRELIM_JF.pdf.
Recovery Bond Charge/Credit: Your bill for electric service includes a charge that has been approved by the CPUC to repay bonds issued for certain costs related to catastrophic wildfires. The Recovery Bond Charge (RBC) rate is currently $\$ 0.00650$ per kWh. PG\&E has also contributed certain amounts to a trust fund which is used to provide a customer credit equal to $\$ 0.00650$ per kWh (Recovery Bond Credit). The right to recover the RBC has been transferred to one or more Special Purpose Entities that issued the bonds and does not belong to PG\&E. PG\&E is collecting that portion of the RBC on behalf of the Special Purpose Entities.
Gas Public Purpose Program (PPP) Surcharge. Used to fund state-mandated gas assistance programs for low-income customers, energy efficiency programs, and public-interest research and development.

About San José Clean Energy (SJCE)
San José Clean Energy is a program of the City of San José and provides its residents and businesses with electricity from sources like solar, wind, and hydropower. SJCE offers the additional benefits of customer choice, community programs, local control, transparency, and accountability.

## Understanding SJCE Charges

SJCE replaces PG\&E Generation Charges. PG\&E continues to provide all electric delivery, billing, and gas services. Under PG\&E Electric Delivery Charges, note the Generation Credit. This is what PG\&E would have charged for power, and now credits back to you. The PG\&E Power Charge Indifference Adjustment and Franchise Fee are factored into SJCE's rate-setting. Learn more.
www.SanJoseCleanEnergy.org/Understandin g-Your-Bill.

SJ Cares is SJCE's program that allows customers enrolled in CARE or FERA financial assistance programs to receive cleaner energy at the lowest possible rates. Learn more: www.SanJoseCleanEnergy.org/Discount-Pro grams.

Please pay your SJCE charges directly to PG\&E (see page 1 of this bill). Do not send payment to San José Clean Energy.

About San José Clean Energy (SJCE)
San José Clean Energy is a program of the City of San José and provides its residents and businesses with electricity from sources like solar, wind, and hydropower. SJCE offers the additional benefits of customer choice, community programs, local control, transparency, and accountability.

SJ Cares is SJCE's program that allows customers enrolled in CARE or FERA financial assistance programs to receive cleaner energy at the lowest possible rates. Learn more: www.SanJoseCleanEnergy.org/Discount-Pro grams.

About San José Clean Energy (SJCE)
San José Clean Energy is a program of the City of San José and provides its residents and businesses with electricity from sources like solar, wind, and hydropower. SJCE offers the additional benefits of customer choice, community programs, local control, transparency, and accountability.

SJCE's standard electricity generation service, GreenSource, provides customers with more renewable power. SJCE also offers a 100\% renewable product, TotalGreen, for a small premium. Learn more.

## Understanding SJCE Charges

SJCE replaces PG\&E Generation Charges. PG\&E continues to provide all electric delivery, billing, and gas services. Under PG\&E Electric Delivery Charges, note the Generation Credit. This is what PG\&E would have charged for power, and now credits back to you. The PG\&E Power Charge Indifference Adjustment and Franchise Fee are factored into SJCE's rate-setting. Learn more.

SJ Cares is SJCE's program that allows customers enrolled in CARE or FERA financial assistance programs to receive cleaner energy at the lowest possible rates. Learn more: www.SanJoseCleanEnergy.org/Discount-Pro grams.

Please pay your SJCE charges directly to PG\&E (see page 1 of this bill). Do not send payment to San José Clean Energy.
