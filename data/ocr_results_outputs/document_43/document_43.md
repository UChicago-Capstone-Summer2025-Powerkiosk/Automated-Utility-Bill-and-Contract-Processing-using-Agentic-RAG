# MASTER ENERGY SALES AGREEMENT 

This Master Energy Sales Agreement (the "MSA" or "Master Agreement")"is entered into by and between MP2 ENERGY LLC as authorized agent for its applicable licensed subsidiary in each instance (the applicable licensed subsidiary, the "Seller"), and CAMBRIDGE PUBLIC HEALTH COMMISSION ("Customer"). Seller and Customer are sometimes referred to herein individually as a "Party" and collectively as the "Parties."
1.1 Form and Construction of Agreement. The terms of this MSA apply to all end-use sales of Energy by Seller to Customer (each sale a "Transaction"). Each Transaction shall be memorialized with a written confirm executed by the Seller and Customer (each a "Transaction Confirmation" or a "TC"). Each TC will include the commercial terms of the Transaction, including but not limited to the Delivery Period, Contract Price, contract quantities in MWh, costs and EDC Regulatory Charges, Delivery Points and any other special provisions agreed to between the Parties. Customer's execution of a TC shall constitute an offer from Customer to Seller to purchase Energy on the terms set forth in the TC and the MSA. Upon Seller's execution of the TC Seller shall sell, and Customer shall purchase and receive the Total Contract Quantity pursuant to the terms and conditions of this MSA and any applicable TC during the Delivery Period set forth on an applicable TC. Any conflict between the terms and conditions of this Agreement and a TC shall be resolved in favor of the applicable TC. This MSA, associated TC(s), and any amendments, addendums, annexes to either the MSA or a TC set forth the single integrated "Agreement" among the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof, and supersede all prior or contemporaneous agreements and understandings (oral or otherwise) among the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof. The Agreement may only be modified by a written agreement signed by both Parties.
1.2 Term. This MSA commences on the date when the first TC hereunder is executed by both Customer and Seller and continues until terminated in writing by both Parties or terminated under Sections 1.7 and 1.8 hereunder, it being the intent of the Parties that even if the MSA is terminated all Transactions between the Parties will be governed by the terms and conditions set forth in this MSA, as such MSA may be amended in writing from time to time and the termination of this MSA shall in no way release a Party from any obligations existing hereunder or under any effective TC prior to the end of a Delivery Period or Renewal Period. Upon expiration of a Delivery Period unless the Parties have executed a new TC with respect to the Delivery Points, Customer shall continue to purchase and receive the Energy delivered to the Delivery Points at the Hold-Over Rate for successive one-month terms (each a "Renewal Period") until either Party notifies the other Party in writing of its intention to terminate the TC at least twenty (20) days prior to the end of each Renewal Period. Upon timely notice of termination being received by the non-terminating Party, the termination date shall be the next effective drop date after the notice period as permitted by the EDC. The Contract Price during the Renewal Period shall be the Hold-Over Rate set forth on the applicable TC. The terms of this MSA will govern during the Renewal Period(s).
1.3 Title, Risk of Loss and Taxes. Title, liability and risk of loss associated with the Energy purchased and sold hereunder shall pass to Customer at the Delivery Point(s) specified on the applicable TC. Seller is responsible for Taxes arising prior to the Delivery Point and Customer is responsible for Taxes arising at and after the Delivery Point. If Customer claims exemption from Taxes, Customer shall provide Seller a certificate of exemption.
1.4 Credit. Seller's entry into this MSA and each Transaction is contingent upon Customer, any guarantor or any successor maintaining its creditworthiness during the term of any Transaction and any Renewal Period. If Customer's payment history, credit or financial condition becomes unsatisfactory as determined by Seller in a commercially reasonable manner Seller may request, and Customer shall furnish Seller, Performance Assurance in a form and amount acceptable to Seller within three (3) Business Days of the request. In no event will the amount of the Performance Assurance be more than three (3) times Customer's estimated largest monthly invoice amount.
1.5 Billing and Payment. The method of billing applicable to a Transaction will be as set forth on a TC and will be either Utility Consolidated Billing ("UCB"), Dual Bill Option ("DBO" or "Dual Billing") or Supplier Consolidated Billing ("SBO"). If Customer elects UCB Customer's EDC will invoice Customer monthly for a) the Energy supplied by Seller under this Agreement, b) the EDC Regulatory Charges, and c) any applicable Taxes and payment will be made directly to the EDC by the date specified on the UCB invoice. If Customer elects DBO Customer will instead receive both a monthly invoice from Seller for Energy and a separate monthly invoice from the EDC for EDC Regulatory Charges and Taxes, then following each meter

read date, Seller will deliver to Customer an invoice setting forth the charges due for Energy. If available and Customer elects SBO Customer will receive one invoice from Seller for i) Energy supplied by Seller under this Agreement, ii) the EDC Regulatory Charges, and iii) any applicable Taxes and payment will be made directly to Seller by the date specified on the SBO invoice. In the event that Seller does not receive usage data from the EDC, Seller may reasonably estimate Customer's use and such estimate shall be adjusted when the actual consumption is received from the EDC. In the event of SBO or Dual billing, Seller's invoice will be sent via email or mail to Customer. In the case of SBO or DBO the day the invoice is sent is hereafter referred to as the "Sent Date." Payment shall be made by ACH, wire transfer, or check within 30 days of the Sent Date and unless directed otherwise by Seller. Overdue invoices will accrue interest at the statutory rate referenced for governmental entities in the state in which the Delivery Points are located. With respect to all forms of billing and invoices, Customer is responsible for all reasonable costs and fees incurred by Seller in collecting payment. If Customer disputes any amount on an invoice in good faith, Customer will contact Seller promptly in writing, stating the basis for the dispute and shall pay the undisputed amount by the due date; the amount in dispute may be withheld until the dispute is resolved. If the amount disputed is determined to be correct, it shall be paid (plus interest accrued under the above calculation method) within five (5) Business Days of such determination.
1.6 Force Majeure. If a Party is unable because of Force Majeure to perform its obligations hereunder and that Party gives notice of the event to the other Party as soon as practicable after its occurrence, then the obligations of the Party affected by the event (other than payment for Energy received and performance of other transactions or other obligations incurred before the Force Majeure event) will be suspended for the duration of the Force Majeure event. "Force Majeure" means a material, unavoidable occurrence beyond a Party's control, but shall not include inability to pay, an increase or decrease in Taxes or the cost of Energy, the economic hardships of a Party, or the full or partial closure of Customer's facilities, unless such closure itself is due to Force Majeure.
1.7 Events of Default. "Default" means any one of the following: (a) the failure by either Party to make, when due, any payment required under the Agreement and such failure is not remedied within five (5) Business Days after written notice; (b) any assignment or general arrangement for the benefit of creditors made by either Party; or the Bankruptcy or Insolvency of either Party or its guarantor; (c) any unauthorized assignment of a Party's rights or obligations hereunder; (d) failure of a Party to provide Performance Assurance pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and such failure is not remedied within five (5) Business Days after written notice; (e) either Party consolidates or merges into or transfers all or substantially all of its assets to another entity and the resulting transferee or surviving entity fails to assume the obligations of such party under the Agreement; (f) Customer switches to another supplier or otherwise terminates a TC after the date Seller accepts a TC and before the Estimated Start Date as indicated on a TC or Customer switches to another supplier or otherwise terminates a TC after the Estimated Start Date and prior to the end of the Delivery Period; (g) Customer fails to receive all of part of the Total Contract Quantity pursuant to a Transaction and such failure is not excused by Seller's failure to perform or by Force Majeure; or (h) any breach of this Agreement by either Party and such breach is not cured within seven (7) Business Days after written notice. If an event of Default listed in subsection (b) above occurs, the Default will be deemed to have automatically occurred just prior to such event.
1.8 Remedies Upon an Event of Default. In the event of a Default, the non-defaulting Party shall have the right to: (a) accelerate any or all amounts owing between the Parties and liquidate and terminate any and all Transactions hereunder and/or this MSA; (b) withhold any payments due to the defaulting Party; (c) immediately suspend performance under this Agreement; and/or (d) calculate an Early Termination Fee ("ETF"). The ETF shall be due from the defaulting Party to the non-defaulting Party within (5) days of written notice of the ETF ("ETF Notice") being delivered by the non-defaulting Party to the defaulting Party. In the case where Customer is the defaulting Party the ETF is the sum of the positive dollar amount obtained by multiplying (i) Contract Price minus the Underlying Value by (ii) the remaining amount of the Total Contract Quantity that would have been delivered under this Agreement had it not been terminated early plus amounts owed for Energy delivered but not paid plus fees and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees incurred by Seller in connection with collecting all amounts due under this Agreement. In the case where Seller is the defaulting Party the ETF is the sum of the net sum of the positive dollar amount obtained by multiplying (i) Underlying Value minus the Contract Price by (ii) the remaining amount of the Total Contract Quantity that would have been delivered under this Agreement had it not been terminated early less amounts owed for Energy delivered, but not paid plus fees and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees incurred by Customer in connection with collecting all amounts due under this Agreement. The provisions of this section shall be without prejudice and shall be in addition to any right of setoff, combination of accounts, lien or other right to which any Party is at any time otherwise entitled (whether by operation of law, contract or otherwise). If Customer has elected to terminate this Agreement due to Seller's Default such

termination shall be rescinded and of no force and effect if Shell Energy North America (US), L.P. (SENA) elects, during the cure period afforded Seller under this Agreement, to cure the Default or to take an assignment of this Agreement and assume Seller's duties and obligations under this Agreement. The Parties agree that the ETF constitutes a reasonable approximation of damages and is not a penalty or punitive in any respect. Seller may, but is not required to, physically liquidate a Transaction or enter into a replacement transaction to determine the ETF.

# 1.9 Limitation of Liability. IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER PARTY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY OR INDIRECT DAMAGES IN TORT, CONTRACT OR OTHERWISE.

As applicable to products with wholesale energy pricing and/or wholesale costs components that are passed-through to Customer at cost:

- I understand that the volatility and fluctuation of wholesale energy pricing (including LMP or Index pricing) may cause my energy bill to be multiple times higher in a month in which wholesale energy prices are high. I understand that I will be responsible for charges caused by fluctuations in wholesale energy prices.
- For Customers on the Hold-Over Rate: I understand that these potential price fluctuations may include wholesale prices (including LMP or Index pricing); if I am on a holdover, month to month plan, I will be responsible for all such charges.
- I also understand that my energy bill may include a separate assessment of ancillary service charges, which may cause my energy bill to be multiple times higher in a month in which ancillary services charges are high. I understand that I will be responsible for charges caused by fluctuations in ancillary service charges.

# LABEL DESCRIPTION 

## Generation Price and Contract:

Generation Prices displayed are representative average prices for electricity at usage levels that are typical for residential customers. Contract items displayed present the length of your contract for generation service, and the price terms included in your contract. See your recent bills to determine average monthly use, and your Terms of Service for additional information.

## Power Sources

The electricity you consume comes from the New England power grid, which receives power from a variety of power plants and transmits the power throughout the region as needed to meet the requirements of all customers in New England. When you choose a power supplier, that supplier is responsible for generating and/or purchasing power that is added to the power grid in an amount equivalent to your electricity use. Known Resources include resources that are owned by, or under contract to, the supplier. System Power represents power purchased in the regional electricity market. Biomass refers to power plants that are fueled by wood or other plant matter. Hydro resources of greater than 30 megawatts in size are deemed "large hydro". All other hydro resources are deemed "small hydro". Other Renewables include fuel cells utilizing renewable fuel sources, landfill gas, and ocean thermal.

## Emissions:

Emissions for each of the following pollutants are presented as a percent of the regional average emission rate. Arrows represent, for each pollutant, the emission rate from hypothetical new generation facility.
Carbon Dioxide $\left(\mathrm{CO}_{2}\right)$ is released when fossil fuels (e.g., coal, oil, and natural gas) are burned. Carbon Dioxide, a greenhouse gas, is a major contributor to global warming.
Nitrogen Oxides $\left(\mathrm{No}_{x}\right)$ form when fossil fuels and biomass are burned at high temperatures. They contribute to acid rain and ground-level ozone (or smog) and may cause respiratory illness in children with frequent high-level exposure. $\mathrm{No}_{x}$ also contributes to oxygen deprivation of lakes and coastal waters which is destructive to fish and other animal life.
Sulfur Dioxide $\left(\mathrm{SO}_{2}\right)$ is formed when fuels containing sulfur are burned, primarily coal and oil. Major health effects associated with $\mathrm{SO}_{2}$ include asthma, respiratory illness and aggravation of existing cardiovascular disease. $\mathrm{SO}_{2}$ combines with water and oxygen in the atmosphere to form acid rain, which raises the acid level of lakes and streams, and accelerates the decay of buildings and monuments.

## Labor Data:

The information on this label regarding whether generators or suppliers operate under collective bargaining agreements is provided to inform you about whether the energy was produced in plants where employee wages and working conditions are mutually determined by employees and management and protected by union contracts. The information on this label regarding the use of replacement employees during a labor dispute is provided to inform you of whether or not a generator or supplier during a strike by a lock-out of its employees has replaced them with other workers.
