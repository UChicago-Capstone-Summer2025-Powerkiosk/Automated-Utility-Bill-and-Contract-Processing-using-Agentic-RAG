In the event that such 12-month period data is not available, the Baseline Usage shall be determined based upon best available usage information. If Seller determines that Buyer's Metered Usage (a), as established by the DSP has materially changed or (b) is likely to materially change, in either case, as compared to past practice or the historical data provided by the DSP for Buyer's Delivery Points, Seller may, in addition to other remedies provided for herein, add to the amount paid by Buyer, as specified in the 'Pricing' section above, the amount necessary to account for Seller's incremental costs resulting from or likely to result from, as applicable, the change to Metered Usage.

On-Site Generation Disclosure: The Buyer hereby represents and warrants to Seller that there is no existing on-site generation installed at any of Buyer's Delivery Point(s) set forth in this Sales Confirmation, except as listed in Table 1 below.

Material Reduction shall mean Buyer's Metered Usage reduces by more than $15 \%$ as compared to Baseline Usage. If Seller determines that Buyer's Metered Usage has materially changed as a result of new or increased self-generation, Seller may add to the amount paid by Buyer, as specified in the Pricing section above, the amount necessary to account for Seller's incremental costs resulting from or likely to result from the change in Metered Usage.
