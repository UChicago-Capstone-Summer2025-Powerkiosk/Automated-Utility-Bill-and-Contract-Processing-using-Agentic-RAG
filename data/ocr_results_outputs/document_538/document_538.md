Thank you for your payment.
Duke Energy does not maintain customers' natural gas piping after or downstream of the meter. You should maintain such piping by periodically inspecting for leaks. If the piping is metal, you should also check for signs of corrosion. You should repair such piping if leaks or corrosion are discovered. For assistance locating, inspecting or repairing buried piping, please contact a licensed heating/plumbing contractor. You should always call 811 prior to digging. Once your lines are marked, always dig by hand if digging near natural gas piping.

To help us repair malfunctioning streetlights, quickly: 1. Visit duke-energy.com/lightrepair 2. Provide us with the light's location and your contact information. 3. Specific addresses, landmarks and directions work best.

Mail your payment at least 7 days before the due date or pay instantly at duke-energy.com/billing. Late payments are subject to a $1.5 \%$ late charge.

Please return this portion with your payment. Thank you for your business.
