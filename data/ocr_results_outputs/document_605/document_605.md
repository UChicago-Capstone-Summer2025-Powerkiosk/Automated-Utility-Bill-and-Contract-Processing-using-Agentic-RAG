This bill reflects BPU-approved changes in the Delivery portion of your electric bill effective on and after August 1, 2024. The increase in the Delivery portion of your bill is due to changes related to the Electric Conservation Incentive Program. As a result of these changes, a typical residential customer who receives electric Supply from PSE\&G and uses 577 kilowatt-hours in an average month will see an average monthly increase of $\$ 0.73$ or $0.57 \%$. Tariff information may also be found by visiting pseg.com.
