If the Purchase Price incorporates an index and the index is not announced or published on any day for any reason or if the Seller reasonably determines that a material change in the formula for or the method of determining the Purchase Price has occurred, then the Parties will use a commercially reasonable replacement price calculated by the Seller.
4. Changes to Purchase Price: In the event there is a change to any tariff, law, order, rule, tax, regulation, transmission rate, or any LDC, EDC or ISO changes to supplier obligations to serve, which increase Seller's costs, the Purchase Price may be adjusted by Seller to include such costs.
5. Billing and Payment: Seller will invoice Buyer for the Actual Quantity of Commodity and for any other amounts for which Buyer is responsible under this Agreement. Except as otherwise set forth herein, payment is due within 15 days of the date of the invoice.

10. Force Majeure: Other than payment obligations, a Party claiming Force Majeure will be excused from its obligations under Section 2 only if it provides prompt notice of the Force Majeure, uses due diligence to remove its cause and resumes performance as promptly as reasonably possible. During a Force Majeure, Buyer will not be excused from its responsibility to pay for Balancing Charges nor from its responsibility to pay for Commodity received. "Force Majeure" means a material, unavoidable occurrence beyond a Party's control, and does not include inability to pay, an increase or decrease in Taxes or the cost of Commodity, the economic hardships of a Party, the full or partial closure of Buyer's facilities, unless such closure itself is due to Force Majeure.
11. Financial Responsibility: Seller's entry into this Agreement and each Transaction is conditioned on Buyer, its parent, any guarantor or any successor maintaining its creditworthiness during the Delivery Period and any Renewal Term. When Seller has reasonable arounds for insecurity regarding Buyer's ability or

willingness to perform all of its outstanding obligations under any agreement between the Parties, Seller may require Buyer to provide adequate assurance, which may include, in the Seller's discretion, security in the form of cash deposits, prepayments, letters of credit or other guaranty of payment or performance ("Credit Assurance').
13. Default: "Default" means: (i) failure of either Party to make payment by the applicable due date and the payment is not made within 3 Business Days of a written demand; (ii) failure of Buyer to provide Credit Assurance within 2 Business Days of Seller's demand; (iii) any representation or warranty made by a Party in this Agreement proves to have been false or misleading in any material respect when made or ceases to remain true and such breach is not cured within 15 Business Days after written notice; (iv) a secured party has taken possession of all or any substantial portion of its assets or is dissolved or has a resolution passed for its winding-up, official management or liquidation (other than pursuant to a consolidation or merger; (v) failure of a Party to fulfill any of its obligations in this Agreement (except as otherwise provided in subsections (i), (ii) (iii) and (iv) hereof) and such failure is not cured within 15 Business Days after written notice; provided that no cure period or demand for cure applies to an early termination of a Transaction Confirmation by Buyer or under Section 15(A)(iii).
14. Remedies: In the event of a Default, the non-defaulting Party may: (i) withhold any payments or suspend performance; (ii) accelerate any amounts owing between the Parties and terminate any Transactions and/or this Agreement between the Parties and/or their affiliates; (iii) calculate a settlement amount by calculating all amounts due to Seller for Actual Quantity and the Close-out Value for each Transaction being terminated; and/or (iv) net or aggregate all settlement amounts and all other amounts owing between the Parties and their affiliates under this Agreement and other energy-related agreements between them and their affiliates, whether or not due and whether or not subject to any contingencies, plus costs, into one single amount ("Net Settlement Amount"). Any Net Settlement Amount due from the defaulting Party to the non-defaulting Party will be paid within 3 Business Days of written notice from the non-defaulting Party. Interest on any unpaid portion of the Net Settlement Amount will accrue daily at the Interest Rate. "Close-out Value" is the sum of (a) the amount due to the non-defaulting Party regarding the Contract Quantities (or, as applicable, estimated Contract Quantities) remaining to be delivered as stated in the applicable Transaction Confirmation(s) during the Delivery Period or, if applicable, the current Renewal Term, calculated by determining the difference between the Purchase Price and the Market Price for such quantities; and (b) without duplication, any net losses or costs incurred by the non-defaulting Party for terminating the Transaction(s), including costs of obtaining, maintaining and/or liquidating commercially reasonable hedges, Balancing Charges and/or transaction costs. "Market Price" means the price for similar quantities of Commodity at the Delivery Point during the Delivery Period or Renewal Term. For purposes of determining Close-out Value, Market Price may be established by Seller through information available to Seller internally or through third parties. The Parties agree that Close-out Value constitutes a reasonable approximation of damages and is not a penalty or punitive in any respect. Physical liquidation of a Transaction or entering into a replacement transaction is not required to determine Close-out Value or Net Settlement Amount. The defaulting Party is responsible for all costs and fees incurred for collection of Net Settlement Amount, including, reasonable attorney's fees and expert witness fees.
