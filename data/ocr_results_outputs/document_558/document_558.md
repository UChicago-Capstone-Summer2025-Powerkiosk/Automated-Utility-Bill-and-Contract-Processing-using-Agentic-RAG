The following are definitions of common terms that may appear on your Ameren Illinois utility bill. Ameren Illinois is responsible for the delivery of your natural gas and/or electricity and is referred to below as "utility." For additional definitions, or detailed information on rates, to view your bill or learn about payment options, energy supply options, energy efficiency and more, visit AmerenIllinois.com or call the phone number listed on the front of this bill.

AMOUNT PAYABLE AFTER DUE DATE / LATE PAYMENT CHARGE - A 1.5 percent Late Payment Charge will be applied to any unpaid balance after the due date.
BILLING SEASONS - Summer months are June, July, August and September. All other months are non-summer.
CUSTOMER CHARGE - Recovers costs of providing energy service that occur even if you do not use electricity or natural gas in the billing period. Included in the charge are billing, accounting and other supplemental charges. For gas service, this also recovers basic gas metering costs.
DISTRIBUTION DELIVERY CHARGE - Recovers the costs of infrastructure, maintenance and services incurred by the utility to deliver electricity and/or natural gas to customers through the distribution system.
EDT COST RECOVERY - Allows the Company to recover the cost of an electric distribution tax imposed on the Company under the Public Utilities Revenue Act. The Company receives no profit from this charge. ELECTRIC SUPPLY - Recovers the cost of electricity that the utility has purchased from suppliers. (These charges apply only to customers who have not chosen a third-party supplier.) The utility provides electric supply under one of two rate options: Basic Generation Service (BGS) or RealTime Pricing (RTP). The utility does not profit from BGS or RTP supply charges. Regardless of your supplier, the utility remains responsible for delivering your electricity.
ENVIRONMENTAL ADJUSTMENT / FACTOR- Recovers costs incurred by the utility for environmental clean-up of former gas manufacturing sites.
GAS CHARGE (PGA) - Recovers the cost of natural gas that the utility purchases from suppliers and delivers to customers. The utility receives no profit from this charge.
ILLINDIS STATE COMMERCE COMMISSION TAX - Tax on natural gas consumption; proceeds are used to operate the Illinois Commerce Commission.
ILLINDIS STATE ELECTRICITY EXCISE TAX - Tax on electricity consumption.
ILLINDIS STATE GAS REVENUE TAX - Tax on natural gas consumption. kW (KILOWATT) - A unit of measure of the rate at which electrical energy is used. Ten, 100-watt light bulbs turned on at the same time will use electrical energy at a rate of 1,000 watts or 1 kilowatt (kW).
kWh (KILOWATT-HOUR) - A unit of measure of electricity used in one hour. Ten, 100-watt light bulbs burning for one hour would use 1,000 watts, which is equal to 1 kilowatt-hour (kWh) of electricity.
METER CHARGE - Recovers the basic costs of providing electric metering services if they are provided by the utility.
METER MULTIPLIER - Conversion factor required to determine the actual amount of energy used.
MUNICIPAL CHARGE - Tax imposed by a local municipality.
NO. DAYS - Number of days in the present billing period, which may vary monthly. When you compare bills, compare the number of days in each billing period as well as the energy used.
PURCHASED ELECTRICITY ADJUSTMENT - Allows the utility to match electric power and energy costs with electric power and energy revenue.
RD (Meter Reading) - Used to calculate the bill.

| A - Actual Reading | C - Customer Reading |
| :-- | :-- |
| E - Estimated Reading | R - Revised Reading |

SUPPLY COST ADJUSTMENT - Allows the utility to recover costs associated with the administration of electric supply service.
THERM - The basic unit for measuring your natural gas consumption.
THERM FACTOR - Converts the basic usage or volume of gas from cubic feet to therms.
TOTAL LIGHTING CHARGES - Summary of charges for optional outdoor lighting service.
TRANSMISSION SERVICE CHARGE - Recovers costs associated with electric transmission service.
USAGE - Amount of energy used, measured in kWh for electricity and therms for natural gas. This amount is derived by subtracting the previous meter reading from the present meter reading and multiplying the result by the meter multiplier.
USE PER DAY (Table) - Shows your average use of energy per day and the average temperature during the present billing period and during the comparable period a year ago.
