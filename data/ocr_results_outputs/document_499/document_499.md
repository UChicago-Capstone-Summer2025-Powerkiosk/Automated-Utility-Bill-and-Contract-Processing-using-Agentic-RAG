# Constellation NewEnergy, Inc. <br> Ohio Electricity Supply Agreement 

TOLEDO MUSEUM OF ART ("Customer") AND Constellation NewEnergy, Inc. ("Seller") AGREE AS FOLLOWS:
Defined Terms. Capitalized terms have the meanings set out in this Electricity Supply Agreement, including the attached General Terms and Conditions ("Agreement"); generally the words "you" and "your" refer to the Customer listed above and the words "we" and "us" refer to Seller, unless the context clearly requires otherwise.

Purchase and Sale of Electricity. You will purchase and receive, and we will sell and supply all of your electricity requirements at the prices set forth below for each account identified in the Account Schedule below ("Account"). By signing this Agreement, you authorize us to enroll each Account with your UDC so that we can supply those Account(s). You will take such actions as we request to allow us to enroll each Account in a timely manner. You agree that we may select such sources of energy as we deem appropriate to meet our obligations under this Agreement. We will enroll each Account with the applicable UDC as being supplied by us and will take such other actions with the applicable UDC and ISO necessary for us to meet our obligations under this Agreement.

The specific prices for each Account are set forth in the Account Schedule, below. You are also responsible to pay (1) Taxes - which we will pass through to you on your bill or as part of the price of electricity, as may be required by law, rule or regulation and (2) UDC charges for delivery/distribution services if we provide you a single bill that includes UDC charges. We will apply all appropriate Taxes unless and until you provide a valid certification of tax exempt status. The UDC charges (if any) and Taxes are charged to you as a "pass-through," which means they will change during the existing term of this Agreement if and as the related charges assessed or charged vary for any reason, including but not limited to the types of changes described above.

Affirmative Consent. You expressly provide your affirmative consent to modify the Price as described in the Change in Law provision in Section 5 of the General Terms and Conditions below.

Cost Components. For each of the items listed as "Passed Through" below, this means that you will be charged the costs associated with the line item in accordance with the definitions of each item in Section 1 Definitions of the General Terms and Conditions. If a cost component below is listed as "Included in Price subject to Change in Law" then such cost(s) are included in the contract price(s) in the Account Schedule below and are only subject to change if there is a change in law as described in Section 5 of the General Terms and Conditions below.

| Energy Costs | Included in Price subject to Change in Law |
| :-- | :-- |
| Ancillary Services And Other ISO Costs | Included in Price subject to Change in Law |
| Auction Revenue Rights Credits | Included in Price subject to Change in Law |
| Capacity Costs | Included in Price subject to Change in Law |
| Transmission Costs | Not Applicable |
| Transmission Loss Credits | Included in Price subject to Change in Law |
| Line Loss Costs | Included in Price (Charged Separately) subject <br> to Change in Law |
| FERC Order 745 Costs | Included in Price subject to Change in Law |
| Balancing Congestion Costs | Included in Price subject to Change in Law |

The contract prices contained in the Account Schedule include credit costs and margin as well as Renewable Portfolio Standards Costs. Any applicable RMR Costs are Not Applicable to this Agreement. All other costs listed above as "Included in Price subject to Change in Law" may be subject to change if there is a change in law, as described in Section 5 of the General Terms and Conditions below.
You have elected the "Included in Price subject to Change in Law" option for your "Capacity Costs" as noted in the table above. "Included in Price subject to Change in Law" means we have included Capacity Costs in your contract price (set forth in the Account Schedule) based on the current Capacity Costs associated with your Accounts as of the effective date of this Agreement. Your Capacity Costs will not be subject to change unless there has been a Change in Law pursuant to Section 5 of the General Terms and Conditions below. For avoidance of doubt, except as otherwise agreed to herein, your contract price will

not be adjusted (either upward or downward) to pass through any changes in your Capacity Costs based on changes to the Capacity Obligation for the Account(s). "Capacity Obligation" means the Accounts' Peak Load Contribution provided by the UDC and adjusted to apply any applicable ISO adjustment factors.

Cost Components invoiced directly by the UDC. The extent any of the Cost Components above are "Not Applicable", it means that charges for those Cost Components will be invoiced directly by the UDC ("UDC Charges"). If during the term of this Agreement, some or all of the UDC Charges are no longer invoiced by the UDC, we will pass those charges through to you.

Retail Trade Transactions. At any time during the term of this Agreement, you may request the purchase of renewable energy certificates in an amount equal to a prescribed percentage of your load volume by entering into one or more Retail Trade Transactions ("RTTs") between us. If we both agree to the pricing and terms of the renewable energy certificates purchase, a separate RTT Confirmation signed by both of us will document each such purchase and be incorporated herein.

Term. This Agreement will become effective and binding after you have signed this Agreement and we have counter-signed. Subject to successful enrollment of your Account(s), this Agreement shall commence on or about the date set forth under "Start Date", and end on or about the date set forth under "End Date", unless extended on a holdover basis as described in this Agreement. The actual Start Date is dependent on the UDC successfully enrolling the Account(s) and furnishing us with all necessary information regarding the Account(s) meter read cycle and meter read date(s). The dates set forth in the Account Schedule below reflect UDC information available at that time or as otherwise estimated by us. The actual meter read dates may occur on or about the dates set forth herein. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to begin service to each Account(s) on the actual meter read date on or about the Start Date set forth herein. If we are unable to timely enroll an Account, the Start Date will commence on the next regularly scheduled UDC meter read cycle date following successful enrollment. The End Date will remain the same unless extended for a holdover term. We shall not be liable for any failure to enroll or drop an Account by the Start and End Date due to circumstances beyond our control. We will not be responsible for any gaps in service that may occur between the termination of your service from a prior supplier and the commencement of supply from us.

Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to require or otherwise obligate us to offer to extend the term of this Agreement. If following termination or expiration of this Agreement (whether in whole or in part), for any reason, some or all of the Accounts remain designated by the UDC as being supplied by us, we may continue to serve such Account(s) on a month-to-month holdover basis. During such holdover term, we will calculate your invoice as follows: (Each Account's metered usage, as adjusted by the applicable line loss factor) times (the ISO-published Day Ahead Locational Based Marginal Price for the residual zone ("LMP") $+\$ .015000 / \mathrm{kWh})+$ (a pass through of all costs and charges incurred by us for the retail delivery of energy to you) + Taxes. This Agreement will continue to govern the service of such Accounts during such holdover term. Either party may terminate the holdover term at any time within its discretion at which time we will drop each Account as of the next possible meter read date to the then applicable tariff service, whether default service or otherwise.

Your Invoice. Your invoice will contain all charges applicable to your electricity usage, including Taxes (which are passed through to you). You will receive one invoice from the UDC for UDC charges and one invoice from us for all other charges ("Dual Billing") unless we agree otherwise, or your Account(s) eligibility changes. All amounts charged are due in full within twenty-one (21) days of the invoice date, and we reserve the right to adjust amounts previously invoiced based upon supplemental or additional data we may receive from your UDC. Your invoices will be based on actual data provided by the UDC, provided that if we do not receive actual data in a timely manner, we will make a good faith estimate using your historical usage data and other information. Once we receive actual data we will reconcile the estimated charges and adjust them as needed in subsequent invoices. If you fail to make payment by the due date, interest will accrue daily on outstanding amounts from the due date until the bill is paid in full at a rate of $1.50 \%$ per month, or the highest rate permitted by law, whichever is less. All invoices (including adjustments to those invoices) are conclusively presumed final and accurate unless such invoices are objected to by either you or us in writing, including adequate explanation and/or documentation, within 24 months after the date such invoice was rendered, provided however, we may rebill based on post-period audits or adjustments made by the ISO, UDC, or other governmental authority, commission or agency with jurisdiction in the state in which the Accounts are located.

Certain Warranties. You warrant and represent that for Account(s) located in the State of Ohio, the electricity supplied under this Agreement is not for use at a residence.

Your prior authorization of us to your UDC as recipient of your current and historical energy billing and usage data will remain in effect during the entire term of this Agreement, including any renewal, unless you rescind the authorization upon written notice to us or by calling us at 844-636-3749. We reserve the right to cancel this Agreement in the event you rescind the authorization.

Conditions of Service. For Account(s) located in the State of Ohio, in order for us to perform under this Agreement, you must comply with the terms of the UDC's tariffs and the Account(s) must be successfully enrolled in our name with a switch date assigned by the UDC (the "Conditions of Service"). Those terms, in part, require you to: (a) if applicable, enter into agreements with UDC for distribution service and (b) provide communication link(s) for any interval meter installed or to be installed by the UDC. For accounts located in Dayton Power \& Light service territory, interval meters are required if the most recent 12month period peak demand is equal or greater than 100 kW . For Accounts located in the AEP Ohio or Duke Energy Ohio service territory, interval meters meeting the UDC's requirements and a dedicated analog phone line are required if the most recent 12-month period peak demand is greater than 200kW. You are responsible for the incremental costs of the interval meters and dedicated phone line (as applicable) and the incremental costs associated with the installation of the required interval metering and dedicated phone line (as applicable). You must sign and submit to the UDC, with a copy to us, a work order request before we can enroll the Account. Should you fail to install the required equipment, you acknowledge that the UDC may choose to switch your Account(s) back to UDC service.
Environmental Disclosure Information. For Account(s) located in the State of Ohio, our electricity supply may be purchased from any number of sources. We are not purporting to sell power from a specific source-e.g. renewable fuels. Data concerning the generation resource mix and environmental characteristics of our electricity products is included as Exhibit A hereto and incorporated herein by reference and will be made available periodically with our invoices and is available upon request.
Right to Rescission. For Account(s) located in the State of Ohio, if your Account(s) is classified by the UDC as a "Small Commercial Customer" (defined as a commercial or industrial customer using less than 700,000 kWh annually and not part of a national account with multiple facilities in one or more states), you will receive a confirmation notice from your UDC indicating your selection of Seller as your Competitive Retail Electric Service Supplier ("CRES Supplier"). Upon receipt of the notice, you may rescind this Agreement without penalty at any time within the 7 -day rescission period by following the instructions provided by the UDC. You must write or call the UDC to submit your rescission request by following the instructions on the UDC notice.
Right to Cancel. For Account(s) located in the State of Ohio, if you are a Small Commercial Customer and you move outside of where we provide service or into an area where we charge a different price, either of us may terminate the Agreement without penalty. We have the right to terminate this Agreement for any failure by you to comply with any material obligations as more specifically set forth in Sections 3 and 4 of our General Terms and Conditions attached hereto. If you are a Small Commercial Customer, we have to provide you 14 days prior written notice if we exercise our rights to terminate this Agreement pursuant to our rights set forth in Section 4 of our General Terms and Conditions attached hereto. Also, as a Small Commercial Customer, if we fail to comply with any material obligations, you may also terminate the Agreement and are entitled to the same remedies available to us, including those set forth in Section 4 of the General Terms and Conditions. Should the Agreement be canceled, terminated or expired, you agree to remit full payment, without offset or reduction of any kind, within 21 days of a final invoice date, of all outstanding charges, inclusive of all applicable fees and collection costs. Upon cancellation of this Agreement, your electric service will automatically default to the UDC's Standard Service Offer supply unless you select another CRES Supplier. You acknowledge that taking service under the UDC's Standard Service Offer supply will mean a return to regulated electric service, including energy, transmission and distribution services provided by the UDC under its applicable tariffs. Such UDC service does not necessarily entitle you to the same rates, terms and conditions that apply to other customers served by the UDC.
Right to Request/Release Information. For Account(s) located in the State of Ohio, you may request, twice within a 12-month period, up to 24 months of your payment history information with Seller without charge from Seller. Seller is prohibited from disclosing Small Commercial Customer's social security number or UDC account number without the Customer's affirmative written consent, except for Seller's collections and credit reporting, any participation in programs subject to the universal service fund pursuant to Section 4928.54 of the Ohio Revised Code, or assigning this Agreement to another CRES Supplier pursuant to the assignment provisions of this Agreement.
Right to Renew. For Account(s) located in the State of Ohio, if you are a Small Commercial Customer, you also acknowledge and agree that if for any reason you fail to renew this Agreement and/or if any Account(s) remain designated at the UDC as being served by us, we may continue to serve your Account(s) on a month-to-month basis at the Holdover Rate described in the Term Section above, even though such Holdover Rate is a change in your price under this Agreement.
Budget Billing/UDC Billing. For Account(s) located in the State of Ohio, Seller does not offer budget billing. Your failure to timely pay all applicable UDC charges to the UDC may result in your Account(s) being disconnected. You acknowledge that your price is in addition to any amount that may be charged to you by your UDC as a switching fee pursuant to us enrolling your Account(s) with such UDC.

5. Changes in tariff or law. We may pass through or allocate, as the case may be, to you any increase or decrease in our costs related to the electricity and related products and services sold to you that results from the implementation of new, or changes (including changes to formula rate calculations) to existing, Laws, or other requirements or changes in administration or interpretation of Laws or other requirements. "Law" means any law, rule, regulation, ordinance, statute, judicial decision, administrative order, ISO business practices or protocol, UDC or ISO tariff, rule of any commission or agency with jurisdiction in the state in which the Accounts are located.

Such events shall not excuse failure to make payments due in a timely manner for electricity supplied to you prior to such event. Further, if such an event prevents or makes it impossible or impracticable for the claiming party to carry out any obligation under this Agreement due to the events beyond either of our reasonable control for more than 30 days, then whichever one of us whose performance was not prevented by such events shall have the right to terminate this Agreement without penalty upon 30 days' written notice to the other.
7. UDC or ISO obligations. We will have no liability or responsibility for matters within the control of the UDC or the ISO-controlled grid, which include maintenance of electric lines and systems, service interruptions, loss or termination of service, deterioration of electric services, or meter readings.

IN NO EVENT WILL EITHER PARTY OR ANY OF ITS RESPECTIVE AFFILIATED COMPANIES BE LIABLE FOR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, LOST OPPORTUNITIES OR LOST PROFITS NOT CONTEMPLATED BY SECTION 4. Each party's total liability related to this Agreement, whether arising under breach of contract, tort, strict liability or otherwise, will be limited to direct, actual damages. Direct, actual damages payable to us will reflect the early termination payment calculation in Section 4. Each party agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate damages it may incur. NO WARRANTY, DUTY, OR REMEDY, WHETHER EXPRESSED, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, ON OUR PART IS GIVEN OR INTENDED TO ARISE OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING ANY WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR USE.
9. DISPUTE RESOLUTION.
