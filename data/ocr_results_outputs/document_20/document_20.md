# General Terms and Conditions 

1. REQUIREMENTS - Infinite Energy will sell to You, and You will purchase from Infinite Energy, all of Your natural gas needs for the service address(es) specified in this Agreement. Unless otherwise agreed upon by the Parties, You shall not switch to an alternate energy source.
2. CONTRACT VOLUME - Infinite Energy will base Your monthly expected usage for the duration of this Agreement on either one or a combination of the following methods: (a) Historical Usage: Your previous twelve (12) months consumption; (b) Estimated Usage: an estimate based on similarly situated customers' consumption; or (c) Nominated Usage: monthly amount of natural gas requested by You or on Your behalf.
3. CREDIT - You may be required to provide a deposit, a letter of credit, a guaranty of payment from a third party, or some other security, which is satisfactory to Infinite Energy. This Agreement allows Infinite Energy to obtain credit and Transporter information including, but not limited to, historical and future usage, meter readings, types of service, and payment information. By signing this Agreement, You are authorizing the release of the above information to Infinite Energy for the duration of this Agreement, and You have the right to rescind the authorization for release of the above information at any time by contacting Infinite Energy. If You rescind Your authorization or fail to provide the security that Infinite Energy requests within two (2) business days, Infinite Energy reserves the right to immediately terminate this Agreement with no further notice.
4. INVOICING AND PAYMENT - Infinite Energy will bill You each month for natural gas supply and other services, if any. You may elect to have a third party receive Your invoices; however, You will be responsible for all payments. Infinite Energy will calculate Your invoices based on meter readings received from Your Transporter. If no meter data is forwarded to Infinite Energy in a billing month, Infinite Energy may estimate Your invoice or include charges for more than one month on a subsequent invoice. Your invoices shall be due within fifteen (15) days from the invoice date. Late payments or partial payment balances will be subject to the lesser of a late fee of $1.5 \%$ of the outstanding balance per month or the maximum rate allowable by law. Infinite Energy reserves the right to include on your invoice any charges or credits necessary to correct estimated invoices, meter read errors, miscalculations of taxes, fees, or other charges, invoice errors, and any other error or omission. You shall pay Your invoices to Infinite Energy by either wire transfer or Automated Clearing House. You will be billed for all outstanding balances and fees. You shall remain responsible for any collection agency fees, attorney's fees (including in-house counsel fees), court costs, and all other costs of collecting such outstanding balances.
5. TITLE AND TAXES - Title to the natural gas sold hereunder shall pass from Infinite Energy to You at the Delivery Point(s). Unless otherwise indicated, the Delivery Point shall be Your Transporter's city gate or Your interconnection with Your Transporter. Except as provided herein, each Party shall indemnify and hold harmless the other from all taxes, royalties, fees, or other charges incurred with respect to natural gas to which it has title. You shall be responsible for any taxes, fees, or charges imposed simultaneously with transfer of title. You are responsible for the payment of any state and local taxes and government charges imposed upon Your natural gas service. You must give Infinite Energy any tax exempt certificates related to the natural gas to be sold. The rate at which the natural gas that will be purchased by You pursuant to this Agreement may, in the sole discretion of Infinite Energy, be increased in accordance with any increase in the tariff rates, as well as any tax, levy and cost associated with obtaining, transporting, delivering, and selling the natural gas pursuant to this Agreement. Proof of any such increase will be provided to You upon request.
6. TOLERANCE - You agree to promptly notify Infinite Energy of any changes in Your business process that will materially impact Your natural gas usage for any month. If Your usage is more than twice Your Historical Usage for any given period, Infinite Energy reserves the right to reassess and adjust Your price accordingly; notice of any such increase in price shall be provided to You upon request.
7. FIXED RATES - During the term of these Special Provisions, You may request to fix the price of a mutually agreeable quantity of natural gas for a mutually agreeable price (up to but not exceeding the expected volume of gas that will actually be delivered during that service month). If a fixed price is agreed upon by both parties, then the agreed upon volume for that service month will be invoiced to You at the agreed upon fixed price, and all other volumes of gas actually delivered to You for that service month will be priced to the then current market rates pursuant to this agreement. To the extent that the agreed upon volume of fixed price gas should inadvertently exceed the volume of gas actually delivered during that service month (the excess volume), then Infinite will repurchase the excess volume from You at the then current market rates. Should You request and IEI agree upon more than one fixed price gas purchase transaction during any service month, then the first volumes delivered shall be from the oldest fixed price transaction, the second volume delivered shall be from the next oldest fixed price transaction, and so forth.
8. DISPUTE PROCEDURE - If You dispute an invoice, You must first notify Infinite Energy in writing at Infinite Energy, Attn: Legal Department, 7001 SW 24th Avenue, Gainesville, Florida 32607-3704 within ninety (90) days of the invoice date; if You do not raise Your dispute within this time, You waive all right to do so. After giving written notice, You may withhold payment for the disputed portion only. You shall refrain from taking legal action with regard to the disputed portion of the invoice for a period of fifteen (15) days following receipt of a timely given written notice of the dispute.
9. CONDITIONAL PAYMENTS - Any form of payment You send to Infinite Energy for less than the full balance due that is marked "paid in full" or contains a similar notation, or that You otherwise tender in full satisfaction of a disputed amount, must be sent to the address specified in the DISPUTE PROCEDURE section. Infinite Energy reserves all rights regarding these payments (i.e. if

# General Terms and Conditions 

it is determined there is no valid dispute or if any such payment is received at any other address, we may accept that payment and You will still owe any remaining balance). Infinite Energy may also refuse to accept any such payment by returning it to You, not cashing it or destroying it. You shall send all other payments to the appropriate payment address.
10. TERMINATION OF AGREEMENT BY YOU - You may terminate this Agreement by sending a written notice of cancellation thirty (30) days prior to the desired cancellation date to the address specified in the DISPUTE PROCEDURE section. You shall remain responsible for any and all volumes of gas burned through Your last day of service by Infinite Energy. If You terminate this Agreement prior to its expiration, such termination will be deemed an early termination.
11. TERMINATION OF AGREEMENT BY INFINITE ENERGY - Infinite Energy may terminate this Agreement, in whole or in part, as follows:
a. DisCONNECTION OF SERVICE. Infinite Energy may disconnect Your natural gas service for non-payment of the balance on Your account(s), or pursuant to PSC rules.
b. REYnSAL OF SERVICE. Infinite Energy may refuse to provide natural gas service to You pursuant to PSC rules.
c. MATERIAL BREACH OF THIS AGREEMENT. Infinite Energy may terminate this Agreement as a result of Your material breach of the Agreement.
12. MATERIAL BREACH - The following events will each be deemed a material breach of this Agreement: non-payment by You which results in a termination of this Agreement; failure to pay a deposit assessed under this Agreement; reduction of Your requirements to zero for a period greater than thirty (30) days; Your early termination of this Agreement; Your infringement of any Infinite Energy Intellectual Property right; and Your insolvency, bankruptcy, or appointment of a receiver. Once a material breach has occurred, Infinite Energy may, in its sole discretion, (a) convert Your price to Infinite Energy's standard variable rate; (b) disconnect Your natural gas service; and/or (c) terminate this Agreement. If You commit a material breach of this Agreement, You will pay all costs incurred by Infinite Energy as a result of the breach. Costs include, but are not limited to, reasonable attorney's fees and costs (including in-house legal fees), court costs, and any third party collection fees which Infinite Energy incurs in collection of delinquent balances on Your account.
13. LIQUIDATED DAMAGES - You and Infinite Energy agree damages, as a result of Your material breach of this Agreement, would be difficult, if not impossible, to determine; therefore, if a material breach occurs, whether in whole or in part, Infinite Energy may, in its sole discretion, assess, and You agree to pay, Liquidated Damages in an amount equal to Your Average Monthly Invoice plus Damages.
a) Average MonthLY Invoice. Infinite Energy shall calculate Your Average Monthly Invoice as an amount equal to the sum of one month's average invoice for each service location covered under this Agreement.
b) DAMAGES. Damages are defined as the Net Gas Costs multiplied by the Contract Volume for each month remaining under this Agreement. The Net Gas Costs are determined by taking the positive difference, if any, of the wholesale price of natural gas on Your termination date from the wholesale price of natural gas on the effective date of Your applicable Fixed or indexed rate plus five cents per Dth ( $\$ 0.05 / \mathrm{Dth}$ ) transaction fee.
14. EXPIRATION AND RENEWAL- This Agreement shall automatically renew on a month to month basis, unless cancelled by either Party upon thirty (30) days written notice prior to expiration of this Agreement. The terms of the renewed Agreement shall be the terms disclosed in this Agreement, except that the rate shall be the then effective standard variable rate plus any applicable Service Fee, unless You and Infinite Energy agree to continue the current rate or negotiate a new rate.
15. NO WARRANTIES - Except as expressly set forth herein, Infinite Energy makes, and You receive, no warranty, express, implied, statutory, or otherwise. Infinite Energy specifically disclaims any warranty of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose.
16. FORCE MAJEURE - Except for any obligation to make payments when due, neither Party shall be liable to the other for any delay or failure to perform caused by an occurrence of Force Majeure. Force Majeure occurrences include events outside the control of the Party claiming Force Majeure, which may include, but shall not be limited to, acts of God, strikes, lockouts or other industrial disturbances, acts of public enemy, wars, blockades, insurrections, riots, epidemics, landslides, lightning, earthquakes, fires, hurricanes, storms, floods, washouts, civil disturbances, explosions, accidents to machinery or lines of pipe, the loss or failure of Infinite Energy's gas supply due to Force Majeure, and actions of any government authority, or Transporter, which result in conditions, limitations, rules, or regulations that materially impair either Party's ability to perform hereunder, or any similar cause beyond the control of the Party failing to perform. The affected Party shall give to the other reasonably prompt and detailed notice of the occurrence of any Force Majeure relied upon.
17. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY - Neither Party will be liable to the other Party for any losses, special, incidental, indirect, consequential or punitive damages arising from Your Transporter's service and/or structural damages. Infinite Energy will not be liable to You or any third party for damages of any kind resulting from a breach of this Agreement. In no event will Infinite Energy's liability in connection with this Agreement exceed the difference between the reasonable rate of replacing any undelivered natural gas and Your rate under this Agreement.
18. ASSIGNMENT - This Agreement shall extend to and be binding upon the respective successors and assigns of the Parties; provided, however, that You may not assign this Agreement without Infinite Energy's prior written consent and any purported assignment without such consent shall be void in Infinite Energy's sole discretion.
