Incremental Pricing: For all additional quantities required by Customer, in excess of the fixed quantities listed herein in combination with any other nominated quantities, or for gas quantities bought back from Customer by Constellation due to Customer's requirements being less than the total nominated volumes each month, the price for such additional purchases or buybacks shall be based on the then current market price, as determined by Constellation in its reasonable discretion.

If Constellation and Customer have previously entered into any commodity transaction(s) for the Facility (the "Previous Transaction") that overlap one or more of the delivery months covered in this Transaction Confirmation (the "Overlapping Month(s)"), the incremental gas pricing in this Transaction Confirmation shall apply to the Overlapping Months instead of any conflicting incremental gas pricing associated with the Previous Transaction.

Seller's planned billing method for this facility is to bill Buyer based on: Actual Consumption
Default Service : Should Constellation continue to deliver to Customer beyond the term of this Transaction Confirmation, said deliveries will be made for successive 12 month terms (each an "Extension Term"), until terminated by either party by giving written notice of termination not less than 30 days prior to the expiration of the then-current Extension Term. Each month, the default price (the "Evergreen Price") will equal the applicable published index, plus transportation, fuel and any other charges associated with the delivery of gas to the Delivery Point. Unless otherwise provided by Customer, Constellation will determine Customer's monthly nomination in a commercially reasonable manner based upon Customer's historical usage data.

Electronic Record and Signature Disclosure

# ELECTRONIC RECORD AND SIGNATURE DISCLOSURE 

From time to time, Constellation Energy (we, us or Company) may be required by law to provide to you certain written notices or disclosures. Described below are the terms and conditions for providing to you such notices and disclosures electronically through the DocuSign system. Please read the information below carefully and thoroughly, and if you can access this information electronically to your satisfaction and agree to this Electronic Record and Signature Disclosure (ERSD), please confirm your agreement by selecting the check-box next to 'I agree to use electronic records and signatures' before clicking 'CONTINUE' within the DocuSign system.

## Getting paper copies

At any time, you may request from us a paper copy of any record provided or made available electronically to you by us. You will have the ability to download and print documents we send to you through the DocuSign system during and immediately after the signing session and, if you elect to create a DocuSign account, you may access the documents for a limited period of time (usually 30 days) after such documents are first sent to you. After such time, if you wish for us to send you paper copies of any such documents from our office to you, you will be charged a $\$ 0.00$ per-page fee. You may request delivery of such paper copies from us by following the procedure described below.

## Withdrawing your consent

If you decide to receive notices and disclosures from us electronically, you may at any time change your mind and tell us that thereafter you want to receive required notices and disclosures only in paper format. How you must inform us of your decision to receive future notices and disclosure in paper format and withdraw your consent to receive notices and disclosures electronically is described below.

## Consequences of changing your mind

If you elect to receive required notices and disclosures only in paper format, it will slow the speed at which we can complete certain steps in transactions with you and delivering services to you because we will need first to send the required notices or disclosures to you in paper format, and then wait until we receive back from you your acknowledgment of your receipt of such paper notices or disclosures. Further, you will no longer be able to use the DocuSign system to receive required notices and consents electronically from us or to sign electronically documents from us.

All notices and disclosures will be sent to you electronically

Unless you tell us otherwise in accordance with the procedures described herein, we will provide electronically to you through the DocuSign system all required notices, disclosures, authorizations, acknowledgements, and other documents that are required to be provided or made available to you during the course of our relationship with you. To reduce the chance of you inadvertently not receiving any notice or disclosure, we prefer to provide all of the required notices and disclosures to you by the same method and to the same address that you have given us. Thus, you can receive all the disclosures and notices electronically or in paper format through the paper mail delivery system. If you do not agree with this process, please let us know as described below. Please also see the paragraph immediately above that describes the consequences of your electing not to receive delivery of the notices and disclosures electronically from us.

at CNEGTransactionConfirmations@constellation.com and in the body of such request you must state: your previous email address, your new email address. We do not require any other information from you to change your email address.

If you created a DocuSign account, you may update it with your new email address through your account preferences.

## To request paper copies from Constellation Energy

To request delivery from us of paper copies of the notices and disclosures previously provided by us to you electronically, you must send us an email
to CNEGTransactionConfirmations@constellation.com and in the body of such request you must state your email address, full name, mailing address, and telephone number. We will bill you for any fees at that time, if any.

## To withdraw your consent with Constellation Energy

To inform us that you no longer wish to receive future notices and disclosures in electronic format you may:

i. decline to sign a document from within your signing session, and on the subsequent page, select the check-box indicating you wish to withdraw your consent, or you may;
ii. send us an email to CNEGTransactionConfirmations@constellation.com and in the body of such request you must state your email, full name, mailing address, and telephone number. We do not need any other information from you to withdraw consent.. The consequences of your withdrawing consent for online documents will be that transactions may take a longer time to process..

# Required hardware and software 

The minimum system requirements for using the DocuSign system may change over time. The current system requirements are found here: https://support.docusign.com/guides/signer-guidenging-system-requirements.

Further, if you consent to receiving notices and disclosures exclusively in electronic format as described herein, then select the check-box next to 'I agree to use electronic records and signatures' before clicking 'CONTINUE' within the DocuSign system.

By selecting the check-box next to 'I agree to use electronic records and signatures', you confirm that:

- You can access and read this Electronic Record and Signature Disclosure; and
- You can print on paper this Electronic Record and Signature Disclosure, or save or send this Electronic Record and Disclosure to a location where you can print it, for future reference and access; and
