The image is an illustration showing five analog meter dials, each numbered from 0 to 9. Below the dials, there is text instructing users to draw the hands on the dials as they appear on their electric meter. It advises that if a hand falls between two numbers, the lower number should be reported. There is also a section for digital meter readings with five empty boxes labeled "If you have a DIGITAL METER write the numbers here:" where users can write the numbers displayed on their digital meter.

Draw hands on the dais exactly as they appear on your electric meter. When reading your meter, if the hand fails between two numbers, always report the lower number.
