Summary : This bar chart displays the daily electric usage in kilowatt hours (kWh) over a 13-month period, with each bar corresponding to a month and annotated with the average temperature for that month.

bar chart:

Title & Axes :
  • Title: "Electric Usage History - Kilowatt Hours (kWh)"
  • Y-axis: "kWh/Day", ranging from 0 to 600.
  • X-axis: Months from "Apr" to "Apr" (13 months), each labeled with average temperature in °F (e.g., Apr 47°, May 62°, ..., Apr 45°).

Data Points :
  • Each bar represents a month, with the following approximate values (from left to right):
    – Apr (47°): ~400 kWh/day
    – May (62°): ~430 kWh/day
    – Jun (67°): ~500 kWh/day
    – Jul (74°): ~520 kWh/day
    – Aug (75°): ~570 kWh/day
    – Sep (66°): ~520 kWh/day
    – Oct (51°): ~420 kWh/day
    – Nov (43°): ~350 kWh/day
    – Dec (31°): ~320 kWh/day
    – Jan (34°): ~320 kWh/day
    – Feb (37°): ~320 kWh/day
    – Mar (39°): ~330 kWh/day
    – Apr (45°): ~370 kWh/day (green bar)

Design Encodings :
  • All bars are gray except the final (rightmost) bar for April, which is green.
  • Bars are vertical and of equal width.
  • Average temperature for each month is shown below the month label.

Distribution & Trends :
  • Electric usage increases from April, peaking in August, then declines through the winter months, with a slight increase in the most recent April.
  • The highest usage occurs in August (75°), the lowest in December–February (31°–37°).

Analysis :
  • Electric usage is highest during the summer months (June–September), coinciding with higher average temperatures.
  • Usage drops significantly in the colder months (November–March).
  • The most recent April (green bar) shows a slight increase compared to the previous winter months, but is lower than the previous summer peak.
  • The pattern suggests increased electricity consumption during warmer months, likely due to cooling needs, and reduced usage during colder months.

Summary : This figure presents a breakdown of current electricity charges, separating the costs for supply and delivery, with specific dollar amounts, suppliers, and a horizontal bar visualizing the cumulative charges.

bar chart:
Title & Axes :
  • Title: "Current Charges for Electricity".
  • X-axis: Dollar amount ($), ranging from $0 to $2,370, with tick marks at $0, $474, $948, $1,422, $1,896, and $2,370.
  • No Y-axis; the chart is a single horizontal stacked bar.

Data Points :
  • Supply (blue segment): $1,245.09, representing the cost of electricity from CONSTELLATION NEWENERGY C&I.
  • Delivery (green segment): $1,117.01, representing the cost to deliver electricity from Eversource.
  • Total combined bar length: $2,362.10 (sum of supply and delivery charges, visually extending nearly to the $2,370 mark).

Design Encodings :
  • Blue color for the supply segment, labeled "Supply".
  • Green color for the delivery segment, labeled "Delivery".
  • Large, bolded dollar amounts above each segment.
  • Supplier information for both supply and delivery is provided in text.
  • The supply supplier's address and phone number are listed on the right.

Section: Supplier Information :
  • Supply: CONSTELLATION NEWENERGY C&I, 1001 LOUISIANA ST, STE 2300, HOUSTON TX 77002-5089, 844-636-3749.
  • Delivery: Eversource (no address provided).

Analysis :
  • The supply charge ($1,245.09) is slightly higher than the delivery charge ($1,117.01).
  • Both supply and delivery make up substantial, nearly equal portions of the total electricity bill.
  • The visual emphasizes the significant contribution of both supply and delivery to the overall cost, with no single component dominating.
  • The bar chart format allows for quick comparison of the two main cost components.

Summary : This infographic summarizes a household's electric usage for the current month, comparing it to the same period last year and highlighting the percentage change.

infographic:

  • Section 1 (left): "This month your average daily electric use was 365.0 kWh" (with "365.0 kWh" in blue).
  • Section 2 (center): "This month you used 10.1% less than at the same time last year" (with "10.1% less" in green).
  • Section 3 (right): Large green circle containing "10.1%" and "USAGE" with a downward arrow.

Design Encodings :
