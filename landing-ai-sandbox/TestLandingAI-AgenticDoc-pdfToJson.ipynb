Transactions.  This Master Agreement sets forth the general terms and conditions governing transactions for the purchase, sale and transportation of natural gas and related products and services (each a \\u201cTransaction\\u201d) to one or more of Customer\\u2019s service locations (each, a \\u201cPoint of Service Location\\u201d) as agreed to from time to time and specified in Exhibit B to a Transaction Confirmation. Each Transaction shall be evidenced by a written transaction confirmation (each a \\u201cConfirmation\\u201d) in the form set forth in Exhibit A. If Customer fails to object in writing to any term in the Confirmation within five (5) Business Days of receipt of the Confirmation, the Confirmation shall constitute the definitive written expression of the Transaction. Each Confirmation shall constitute part of and shall be subject to this Master Agreement. Nothing in this Agreement obligates either Party to enter into a Transaction at any time. This Agreement, all Exhibits thereto, and each Confirmation shall constitute a single integrated agreement between the Parties (collectively referred to as the \\u201cAgreement\\u201d). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.116,t=0.156,r=0.481,b=0.414), with ID 1a7a4dba-4faa-4ec2-a1df-8d1be42ff447 -->\\n\\n2.      Services. Commencing on the Delivery Start Date set forth in a Confirmation and continuing throughout the Term, Customer appoints Supplier as its exclusive agent for the supply and/or transportation of natural gas to Customer's Point of Service Locations. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Supplier shall acquire and transport to Customer, and Customer shall purchase and receive, the Contract Quantity of natural gas of the relevant local gas distribution company (\\u201cLDC\\u201d) specified in a Confirmation in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. If the LDC requires Customer to install additional metering and/or related equipment at any Point of Service Location, Customer shall be solely responsible for the costs and installation thereof. Title to all natural gas hereunder shall pass from Supplier to Customer at the Delivery Point and Customer shall have the sole responsibility for transporting gas from the Delivery Point. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.115,t=0.425,r=0.480,b=0.654), with ID 80f6532b-5789-4e4b-99c9-a94fc259fda0 -->\\n\\n2.1 Customer Qualification. Customer acknowledges and agrees that Supplier's duty to provide natural gas under any Confirmation that would require the use of an LDC's facilities is contingent upon the applicable Customer Point of Service Location qualifying for the LDC's appropriate rate or tariff schedule that would permit the use of the LDC's facilities for delivering the natural gas to that Customer Point of Service Location. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.145,t=0.661,r=0.474,b=0.768), with ID 778e4585-39cd-42d1-a817-b22b71398ccc -->\\n\\n2.2 Nominations. The Parties shall coordinate nomination activities such that the deadlines of the transporter of gas by a gas gathering or pipeline company or LDC (each a \\u201cTransporter\\u201d) may be met. If Customer or the LDC fails to provide Supplier with a usage nomination for any month in a timely manner, Supplier (i) may establish a nomination for such month in a commercially reasonable manner based on Customer\\u2019s historical <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.146,t=0.770,r=0.474,b=0.892), with ID 8030fe8b-690e-449f-b880-b5752ca3210a -->\\n\\nusage data available to Supplier, and (ii) shall have  \\nthe right to use and rely on such nomination unless  \\nnotified otherwise by Customer or the LDC. If  \\nSupplier or Customer becomes aware that actual  \\ndeliveries are greater or lesser than the quantity of gas  \\nconfirmed by a Transporter, such Party shall promptly  \\nnotify the other Party. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.559,t=0.155,r=0.886,b=0.250), with ID 6593b861-dde6-4bbe-93c0-b14468a81117 -->\\n\\n2.3 Imbalances. The Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to avoid imposition of any fees, penalties, cash-outs, costs or charges (in cash or in kind) assessed by a Transporter for failure to satisfy balancing and/or nomination requirements (\\u201cImbalance Charges\\u201d). If Supplier or Customer receives an invoice from a Transporter that includes Imbalance Charges, the Parties shall determine the validity and cause of such Imbalance Charges. The Party causing the imposition of the Imbalance Charges will be responsible to pay such Imbalance Charges. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.558,t=0.253,r=0.886,b=0.403), with ID 21105653-7705-485a-bc7d-e37b67af6ecd -->\\n\\n2.4 Transporter Restrictions. If either Party receives an operational flow order or any other usage or operating instructions, restrictions or similar notice (each an \\u201cOFO\\u201d) from a Transporter requiring action to be taken in connection with the t r a n s p o r t a t i o n o r consumption of gas pursuant to a Transaction, such Party will use commercially reasonable efforts to notify the other Party of such event in a timely manner. Such notice may be given by electronic means. Each Party will take all commercially reasonable actions required by the OFO within the time prescribed. If OFO penalties, charges, fees, costs or expenses result from the actions or inactions of one Party, then such Party shall be solely responsible for any such penalties, charges, fees, costs or expenses. Both parties agree that OFOs may require one or both parties to buy or sell quantities of natural gas in the then-current market conditions, which may be appreciably higher or lower than the Contract Price specified in a Transaction. If S u p p l i e r is responsible for nominations and balancing on a Transporter imposing an OFO or similar restriction, S u p p l i e r may (but is not required to) increase or decrease nominations, as appropriate, to avoid penalties. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.556,t=0.405,r=0.886,b=0.720), with ID 26149dd7-b860-477f-8192-0273a47826e5 -->\\n\\n3.

Late payments shall incur interest charges at a rate of interest equal to the lower of a per annum rate of one and one-half percent per month (1.5%) or the maximum applicable lawful interest rate.
